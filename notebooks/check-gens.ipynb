      "At least you know you could get it if you ever wanted to! Sometimes it's good to test the waters like that.\n",
      "No matter where life takes you.\n",
      "Maybe you just need to work on your form!\n",
      "To do what exactly? Drink a gallon of milk everyday raw? That doesn't make sense haha\n",
      "Ohhhh. I see. You were working out and your chest muscles were bulging. Got it.\n",
      "Ha ha punish the toy not the dog!\n",
      "Ouch, sounds like you are going to have to end things with her. Sorry to hear that.\n",
      "Ah bummer, I love taking home leftovers from buffets. Chinese food is my favorite!\n",
      "That is too bad, I hate when you spend a lot of money on food and it is not good\n",
      "Ha ha, thats a good program, how much do you currently bench\n",
      "What movie would you say is truly scary then?\n",
      "Haha, that is a creative way to do it, I like it, maybe I will try that if I ever decide to quit\n",
      "Wow that sounds really scary! Did you do it?\n",
      "Oh cool, do you make things to sell or just for fun?\n",
      "Nice, it always feels good to push yourself during a workout.\n",
      "Did he mind?  Cats can be finicky about their shoes.\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that! I hope you're feeling better now.\n",
      "Ah okay, maybe he will change one day and you guys can get back together\n",
      "I know how that feels, sometimes you just feel down for no reason. Have you tried talking to a therapist?\n",
      "Ugh. I hate when roadkill smells up the whole car. Did you have to drive through it?\n",
      "How much weight do you want to gain?\n",
      "Colonizing mars.   \n",
      "Yes, puppies are so cute\n",
      "well that was pretty mean of him, did you get mad?\n",
      "I eat garlic all the time, never had an issue with it.\n",
      "That is too bad, did your friend understand?\n",
      "Probably not since it was an accident haha\n",
      "Wow, she must have been the center of attention in that dress!\n",
      "Oh wow. Well at least you took care of the problem tooth. Hopefully you do not have any other issues now that you went after so long.\n",
      "It's crazy to think how different life was before the internet.\n",
      "Ah, maybe you're just projecting your own tiredness onto them then. Haha. Animals sleeping doesn't usually relax me.\n",
      "That's so sad. I'm sorry for your loss\n",
      "No worries though, adulthood has its perks too.\n",
      "Remembering but also realizing time goes by fast\n",
      "Now you get a well deserved break before the next one starts.\n",
      "Oh no! Did she get into an accident?\n",
      "that's a great mindset to have! keep it up!\n",
      "probably not they were thinking stomach ha ha\n",
      "That's a good attitude to have when working out. Keeps you motivated.\n",
      "Wow that's a long time! I only do about 10 minutes a day.\n",
      "Then leave him first. Don't wait for him to do it.\n",
      "That's great! Keep practicing and you'll be a pro in no time.\n",
      "Wow that is really sad, did you end things with them?\n",
      "yep exactly, i miss those times, now i work hard to pay bills haha \n",
      "I can imagine! But you got through it and are stronger now!\n",
      "I go about 3-4 times a week for an hour at a time.\n",
      "Ah I see, those topics can get really heated with family.\n",
      "I understand. Give it as much time as you need to heal before getting another one. \n",
      "I hope so too, no one deserves to be treated that way. You deserve better in your life.\n",
      "She will be with you always in spirit. At least she didn't suffer long.\n",
      "thats good they got along\n",
      "That is amazing. I am so happy everything worked out.\n",
      "I know what you mean but you should take the time to rest your brain a bit, you will feel more refreshed when you go back to school in the fall. \n",
      "Oh no, I hate when people chew loudly. Did your sister notice?\n",
      "For sure! You'll look stunning in it!\n",
      "thats awesome! keep it up!\n",
      "hope it works out for you\n",
      "Exactly! Like why are you in such a rush? Just take your time and enjoy getting groceries.\n",
      "Haha, that's a great strategy. Saves you time and ensures you get a good grade.\n",
      "Did you confront your cousin about it?\n",
      "That's great, friends are important to have and keep in touch with. Glad he reached out.\n",
      "Sounds like a perfect weekend to me. I love staying home and relaxing.\n",
      "well dreams are subjective, so everyone has their own interpretation of them! maybe you should try to analyze why you have that dream! maybe there is something that you are not doing in your real life that you want to do!\n",
      "Just keep saving money and one day you will be able to afford one! don't give up hope yet!\n",
      "oh that sounds like a good time, i love lord of the rings\n",
      "I bet it did. It's always nice to reminisce about the past.\n",
      "I would have been so angry if I was you. Maybe file a complaint against them.\n",
      "You definitely can, and I am sure you will come out of this even stronger than before.\n",
      "Yes and then they wonder why they can't keep friends. Ha! I try to stay far away from those types of people.\n",
      "That is really creepy, I would report them to the social media site.\n",
      "I bet you will do great though! Just take it slow and don't look down too much.\n",
      "that doesnt sound good, have you talked to anyone about it?\n",
      "But the results are worth it! You'll feel better overall too.\n",
      "I can imagine, glad everything worked out in the end.\n",
      "With practice you never know, you could be the next Yuna Kim!\n",
      "Definitely try to attend some club meetings or something to meet new people.\n",
      "Well good luck with everything. Just take it one day at a time.\n",
      "Yes I do! but not serious yet.\n",
      "Yes! And don't forget about the roaches! Ugh!\n",
      "They will! Kids always realize what their parents did for them. \n",
      "Yes it is. I live in central florida and its a long drive from one end to the other.\n",
      "That's unfortunate. At least no one was hurt. How are you feeling about it now?\n",
      "Yes patience is key in any relationship.\n",
      "That is good news! Maybe she is getting more social. Thats great she is learning to get along.\n",
      "I don't get to amusement parks often so it would have been a lot of fun for me too!\n",
      "Aww rats are cute little pets, I hope she can pull through! Take her to the vet asap.\n",
      "Yes it does.. time heals everything..\n",
      "Oh no! I would have been so embarrassed! did you at least get your suit back?\n",
      "Yes, there are plenty of fish in the sea! Don't give up hope.\n",
      "Wow that is a lot of music! I hope it does well and you get to go on tour from it.\n",
      "Oh cool! I've never been out of the country. Maybe one day I'll travel the world too!\n",
      "Yes, we just need more of them to lead.\n",
      "yea i would rather not deal with that, good thing my wife's mom watches our kid when he is up in the night\n",
      "I would have been scared too. Did you go with anyone?\n",
      "Haha, I bet. Dogs will eat anything.\n",
      "thats really nice of you, she raised you right.\n",
      "That's so sweet that you're putting so much effort into it! They'll love it.\n",
      "yeah. she had a good life i'm sure\n",
      "oh my god that must have been very scary, thank god you made it home safe, next time consider taking a break and not driving when you are that tired.\n",
      "Oh no.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  You're doing a great job being supportive.  That's all he can ask for.\n",
      "I can understand wanting that kind of life, but I wouldn't want to be married to just anyone for it. Money doesn't buy happiness!\n",
      "maybe just tell her next time you see her. she will understand.\n",
      "i would have been scared too \n",
      "Ohh I see, well then I hope he falls for it!\n",
      "Maybe you can go with them next time they go.\n",
      "that sounds like a lot of fun, i would love to visit washington d.c. someday\n",
      "40 is a big milestone! She must be so excited!\n",
      "Oh wow, that will be satisfying to show her! I hope you have a good time at the reunion.\n",
      "Wow.  That's a long time without power.  I hope your insurance covered the damage.\n",
      "Then you must really stick to your principles. \n",
      "hopefully she learned her lesson from that\n",
      "That's awesome that you have a study group. Good luck on the exam! \n",
      "Oh no,  is she seeing a doctor?\n",
      "It's always nice to have a boss that values your work and rewards you for it.\n",
      "I'm sure you'll meet someone new eventually who treats you better\n",
      "I know how you feel, but you have to force yourself to go out and meet people. Maybe join a club or something.\n",
      "That's so disappointing :( Did you talk to the professor about it?\n",
      "I know.  I want to tell her to stop but I don't want to be rude.\n",
      "I remember using mine to write notes to my crush in class lol\n",
      "That is great! I hope it does sell fast for you.\n",
      "yeah hopefully you can, maybe plan a trip to go see her soon\n",
      "yes that would have been hard to clean up, did she gag while doing it?\n",
      "yeah it's unfortunate that crime can happen anywhere nowadays :(\n",
      "It does fly by.  My oldest is starting middle school this year.  Where did the time go?\n",
      "Haha at least you got your breakfast in! Maybe save some for later though lol.\n",
      "I think you're prepared mentally but it still hits you hard when it actually happens.\n",
      "Aww,  that's very sweet of you to do that\n",
      "Yes it will!  Just keep putting the work out there and something will come along.  Don't give up hope!\n",
      "Maybe your friend will understand if you can't find it.\n",
      "well maybe next year they will remember! dont hold a grudge against them for this year haha\n",
      "No I live alone so no company unfortunately.\n",
      "Yes! And feel the sun on your face. Life is good.\n",
      "Hopefully you were able to get out of the pool quickly after that. Embarrassing.\n",
      "Then buy a rifle with a scope. Dont get a pistol its hard to hit something with.\n",
      "Ah yes, mine does that too. He will curl up in my lap when I'm watching TV but then sleep on my wife's side of the bed. Cats are weird.\n",
      "That's really neat, I bet you'll cherish those items. Did he talk about his work a lot?\n",
      "That's great to hear! I would be worried if he didn't take good care of it.\n",
      "Oh my gosh that is so embarrassing!! Did your friend make a big deal about it or were they understanding??\n",
      "Yes, exactly! I love watching the birds, they are so colorful.\n",
      "Awwwww that's so cute! Ours is a yorkie and a pitbull mix. He's a big puppy still but so cute!\n",
      "Honestly, it will get better with time. Just focus on being happy and moving forward. You don't deserve to be with someone who would do that to you.\n",
      "I get headaches when I don't have my morning coffee!\n",
      "Exactly. Teach her that married couples communicate with each other. She'll do the same thing when she's older and has a spouse. At least you talked it out with her and cleared things up. \n",
      "I used to love playing those games! I should dust off my old computer and play them again.\n",
      "Maybe they were looking for someone with more experience. Or maybe they hired someone internally. Don't let it get you down too much! You'll find something better!\n",
      "Exactly. Life is too short to dwell on the negatives. I hope you continue to stay positive.\n",
      "Yes it does! Boats are expensive but so much fun to have! Enjoy it this summer!\n",
      "That's nice that she paid you back\n",
      "I am so sorry to hear that! Losing a pet is so hard.\n",
      "For sure, i bet its a good workout too.\n",
      "They sure do! Mine is getting so big, its crazy! Im enjoying him being little still though.\n",
      "At least you know you are qualified for the job. Keep applying!\n",
      "Oh no that is not good. Did he say anything about it?\n",
      "What kind of remedies have worked for you?\n",
      "Haha that's so cute. You're a kid at heart playing with his toys.\n",
      "Yeah I only have my phone usually in my car. It is scary to think people will break in just to steal a phone.\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. She was lucky to have such caring people around her.\n",
      "oh cool! what is zelda? a tv show?\n",
      "Its amazing what faith can do for you.\n",
      "Yes time really does fly,my oldest is in college now,seems like just yesterday he was in first grade too.\n",
      "Yes, exactly.  I thought Aretha would be around forever.  She seemed indestructible.\n",
      "I bet it is! I love a good meal that takes some time to make. What kind of sausage did you use?\n",
      "That's awful.  Is there any way to fight it?\n",
      "I hope they do! Fingers crossed!\n",
      "Saves you time in the morning ðŸ˜´\n",
      "That's too bad.  Maybe she should talk to a counselor there.  They can help her deal with it.\n",
      "Good! I'm glad you didn't. Marriage is hard work but it's worth it. Don't ever temptation again. \n",
      "that is good to hear she is doing better now\n",
      "Aww that is so cute! I bet you are enjoying having the little guy around!\n",
      "That's impressive!  What place did you come in?\n",
      "Well at least you didn't hurt yourself! Accidents happen. \n",
      "I see. Well atleast he was working hard for a reason. Maybe he could have found a better job that gave him time with family?\n",
      "Oh wow thats a big promise to break. Maybe he realizes he needs to change that?\n",
      "At least you didn't have to eat something burned or unsafe to eat. At least you got to eat out instead.\n",
      "She/he is in school now?\n",
      "maybe there was a fish kill because of pollution\n",
      "Everyone starts somewhere. Don't worry about it too much.\n",
      "Wow that must have been scary. Did they have to put the dog down?\n",
      "Ha! Losing weight is hard, so I'm glad he couldn't do it! Enjoy your new toy.\n",
      "Definitely stick to your word, friends are important to keep! Where does your friend live?\n",
      "Well atleast you learned your lesson not to hide during hide and seek.\n",
      "Well if it brings you joy to keep it around then I say keep it. It will be a nice memory piece.\n",
      "yea i would be too! i am almost 30 and have not bought a house yet! ha\n",
      "That is so frustrating!! Did you talk to your parents about it? \n",
      "Maybe reach out to a friend and invite them over for a movie night?\n",
      "Family time is the best time. I'm glad you got to have some of that.\n",
      "Yeah, and they are always pacing back and forth. It's sad.\n",
      "I bet it will be, have you been there before?\n",
      "That sounds like fun. I hope you enjoy your new home and all the new experiences.\n",
      "Oh my god, that is so rude of him! I would have done the same thing as you and smashed my binder in his face! \n",
      "That sounds really interesting! I bet you are excited about the opportunity.\n",
      "Oh that sounds like fun! Maybe you can go with her as her guest! \n",
      "I bet it was, did he live?\n",
      "smart to be ahead of it. Less stress that way\n",
      "That is so rude, I hope your insurance covers the damages! \n",
      "Dogs are so happy when they see you after being away from you.\n",
      "Well hopefully he does, or at least has the decency to pay you interest on the loan.  lol  Just kidding, don't charge him interest bro.  haha  But seriously, make sure he pays you back.\n",
      "Yes, there are some horrible people in this world.\n",
      "What are you waiting to find out?\n",
      "Keep applying and eventually the right one will come along.  Don't give up hope.\n",
      "I would have honked my horn and yelled at them if they didnt stop haha, thats just rude to do that!\n",
      "At least it will be a surprise!\n",
      "Accidents happen. Maybe they will be understanding.\n",
      "She was a pitbull mix. The best dog ever.\n",
      "That sounds like a really interesting job.\n",
      "That is great to hear! I hope you do awesome on it.\n",
      "Oh no. Did he get in an accident?\n",
      "oh cool what was it for?\n",
      "oh wow! that sounds like a really interesting job!\n",
      "yes it will, but i am sure you will meet new friends fast!\n",
      "Unless its on sale and you can try something new for cheap.\n",
      "I hope so, I need to get some gardening done this weekend. \n",
      "yes it is. I am sorry for your loss.\n",
      "I have family that lives near the gulf and they always prepare as well.\n",
      "She is very nice.\n",
      "Wow, I had no idea gluten could affect joints too. That must be really painful.\n",
      "Ha!  That is funny.  I would have thought they gave you the wrong drinks.\n",
      "i keep everything. sentimental value.\n",
      "I would do anything for bacon and pancakes too haha.\n",
      "I hope he doesn't accidently let it slip to your best friend! ha ha\n",
      "Exactly. A positive attitude can go a long way.\n",
      "HAHAHA that never works. Save your money. \n",
      "At least you were prepared!!    Accidents happen with little ones.\n",
      "I bet he will, what kind of toy is it?\n",
      "Enjoy every minute of it since its a special occasion.\n",
      "Poor guy! I hope he is okay now.\n",
      "That is great! God will give you what you need when you need it. Don't give up.\n",
      "Thats a little excessive but once in a while isnt too bad! just don't do it every night before bed! haha get some better snacks to munch on before bed!\n",
      "I bet it was!  What did he get?\n",
      "Thats really sweet of you to do that with your kids\n",
      "Did they find out what caused it?\n",
      "Ouch, she needs to stay hydrated and get some medicine from a doctor. Hopefully its just a stomach bug\n",
      "Cats are the best relaxers, they dont judge you or talk back!\n",
      "Did you at least feel like you did well?\n",
      "I bet it was! I need to do that more often.\n",
      "Ewww, I hope they atleast apologized!\n",
      "That's great to hear, what age is she?\n",
      "I hope that you are able to get disability so that you can support yourself.  Your father is a very good man to help you.  You will be able to repay him in some way when you are able to work again.\n",
      "I know how you mean, I hate having to meet new people in general let alone doctors. At least they are helping you feel better though.\n",
      "I can imagine, but also nice to have some \"me time\" too.\n",
      "At least you got to see family though. That's important.\n",
      "Ugh, they need more workers during busy times.\n",
      "Yes funerals can be very emotional. Did you get to say goodbye to him before he passed?\n",
      "Me too one day i will travel there\n",
      "That is awesome that you all stay in touch like that! I am not great at staying in touch with friends like that...but I am trying to get better.\n",
      "I know, I hate when my husband lies about little things like that. But I guess we just have to learn to not get mad over it.\n",
      "Ugh, entitlement is a huge problem these days.  Thats why I try to be nice to everyone no matter what.\n",
      "Yeah my family moved away when she was little so now it's even harder to see her. At least you can facetime her sometimes.\n",
      "That's nice that you get to be with your little one while the big ones are at school! Sounds like you were very prepared for back to school time.\n",
      "I can imagine! I would have been a wreck! Glad everything turned out ok though!\n",
      "Thats terrible. They will regret it when he's gone. Thats not cool at all. Dont let their actions reflect on you and your husband. You guys did the right thing\n",
      "no, i would not trade either, life now is better than back then i believe\n",
      "Oh wow, I've never tried catfish before. Do you like the taste of it?\n",
      "Oh cool!  I've never played dominos at a brewpub before.\n",
      "Yes it is\n",
      "A camera would be a great gift! What kind of camera are you wanting?\n",
      "you will have to bathe the dog too i bet.\n",
      "Have fun! Camping is the best!\n",
      "Oh, I see. That must have been quite scary to hear then.\n",
      "Definitely. I would be worried if I were you. Maybe invest in some rain boots just in case! Haha\n",
      "i would have took it back and got my money back if i paid for it, cake should taste good or you dont eat it\n",
      "Haha  either way it helps your confidence  :)  Good luck with the interview!\n",
      "Haha yes! My grandma makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies too! But chocolate chip are my favorite!\n",
      "i bet she was so excited to start school\n",
      "I have played Minecraft before, it is a lot of fun.\n",
      "Maybe you can find it at a different store or online somewhere.\n",
      "That is awesome! you must have worked hard to get that promotion!\n",
      "Oh cool, that sounds interesting. \n",
      "Yes!  They should be punished severely for what they did.  Poor animals!\n",
      "That does sound like a good time. Who did England play against?\n",
      "They do, cherish every moment! \n",
      "Ewww, I would have ran out of there! Did you kill the frog?\n",
      "Agreed. They should have stayed in jail. \n",
      "I'm sure he will do great no matter what team he's on.\n",
      "One is 3 and the other is 1. They drive me crazy all day!\n",
      "Hopefully you can find something to do to keep your mind off of it!\n",
      "That must have been scary. I would have been afraid to walk near that dog again.\n",
      "That is so sad. At least you were able to give her some love before she passed.\n",
      "that is great that she is doing well.  school helps a lot with that.  mine daughter has adhd so i know what you mean.\n",
      "Yep - and she'll only get better at it!   And probably teach you a thing or two about the game too.   :)  \n",
      "At least you have the receipts to prove you paid. I bet it's a pain having to go out of your way to take care of it though.\n",
      "They sure do.  Glad youre doing better now though!  Divorce is never easy.\n",
      "i would enjoy not having to share a bathroom with someone else!\n",
      "I bet she was pretty mad! Did she make you guys pay for the pizza?\n",
      "I haven't seen that one yet but heard it got bad reviews.  Maybe I won't go see it now.\n",
      "I would confront him about it. \n",
      "Kids can be very demanding at times. I have a 3 year old and she wants my attention all the time.\n",
      "Just be yourself and everything will be fine \n",
      "True but its natural for apples to have worms sometimes\n",
      "I would have been scared.\n",
      "Cute little fluff ball. what color is he. \n",
      "you can always say you shared it with the dog. ha ha\n",
      "Maybe stay away from that part of the park for awhile\n",
      "That feels good to be recognized for hard work.\n",
      "Just enjoy the movie and have fun. They will be jealous when you tell them how good it was.\n",
      "I have seen those before but never photographed one. Maybe I should get a camera to try.\n",
      "Ha! I wouldn't let mine either!! I scolded mine pretty good for that!!\n",
      "Mine will sleep on my head.\n",
      "Just be confident and you will do great.\n",
      "I would have been too..I hate flying..\n",
      "Did he celebrate at all before finding out it was a prank?\n",
      "That is terrible, I hope he got caught.\n",
      "At least he lived a long life with you. It's hard losing a pet. They become part of the family.\n",
      "Maybe he will sing for you when he is not drunk.\n",

      "Well at least she didn't hold a grudge against you. \n",
      "Oh I see, well that makes sense then, you were there to supervise him. I would still be a little nervous letting a friend drive my car even if I was in it with them. \n",

      "Maybe drink more water next time if it's hot out.\n",
      "Just laugh it off and don't let it happen again.\n",
      "Graduating can be stressful, she will be happy to have it over with.\n",
      "Oh wow, I've never heard of that before. Are you taking medicine for it?\n",
      "Did she give you a reason why she didnt tell you?\n",
      "I hope so, she could get in an accident\n",
      "Then I am sure you will do great. What is the test for?\n",
      "Me too, time flies by so fast\n",
      "yes losing a parent is always hard and makes you think about your own life span\n",

      "Yes they do! Hopefully they learn not to do it again. \n",
      "Hopefully you can get some rest tonight.\n",

      "Oh wow. I bet they are excited to see you.\n",
      "I would have been upset too.  Dogs are family. \n",
      "I know how that feels, paying bills can be so stressful! At least you can rest easy now for a little while.\n",
      "that's amazing! being a lawyer sounds like a lot of hard work but rewarding!\n",
      "At least you didn't hurt yourself physically.\n",

      "That's good.  She must have some street smarts.\n",
      "Did they get in trouble?\n",
      "Family is important to have that kind of support\n",

      "Aww dogs are the best. They love unconditionally.\n",
      "Ah gotcha, I see. I guess if you're used to the rough ride then you're used to it. Maybe one day you'll change your mind though.\n",

      "That sounds like a good home remedy.  She should be feeling better soon.\n",
      "That will be a fun time and lots of memories made. Enjoy the time with family. \n",

      "I know what you mean, I play video games a lot and wonder the same thing.\n",
      "Its sad how much money controls our politics. Its not about whats best for the country its whats best for their pocket books.\n",
      "Its sad when pets die, they become part of the family.\n",

      "Did he put anything else in the water?\n",
      "Oh wow I have never had that happen before. I have a dog and he never knocks anything over.\n",
      "That is too bad.  Maybe you can still go without him if it is someplace you really wanted to go.\n",
      "i try to be thankful for every day i have\n",
      "yeah they are gross i hate when they get in the house\n",
      "Maybe if you study some more you will do better on the test.\n",
      "Exactly.  Its so nice and quiet.  I love it.\n",
      "Oh, well then that's a different story! I'm glad they surprised you! That's really nice of them. I wish more people did things like that for me.\n",
      "Did you pay her back already?\n",
      "The food. Mexican food is amazing there.\n",
      "I bet you are proud of yourself.\n",
      "Poor kid.  Sugar makes me throw up too!\n",
      "Kids never listen until they hurt themselves.  Then they learn.\n",
      "Oh yeah, I love their queso too! I wish there was a Qdoba closer to me. The one I go to is about 30 minutes away.\n",
      "Those kids are amazing! I wish I could learn another language fluently.\n",
      "That is impressive. What does he manage?\n",
      "That must make you feel proud as a parent.\n",
      "I wouldn't trust him after that.\n",
      "Yeah sometimes stories dont translate well through text or over speech, you gotta find the right audience for them\n",
      "I would have been mad.\n",
      "ask your co workers if they know of one!\n",
      "Know what, if he has a crush on you and you dont know then you should find out ha ha.\n",
      "Maybe your neighbor should train it better.\n",
      "What situation? Is he cheating on you?\n",
      "Well maybe plan a visit then?\n",
      "No problem. Hard days are the worst.\n",
      "That is great news. Congratulations.\n",
      "Maybe she is going through the \"I hate you mom/dad\" phase. She will come around.\n",
      "that would be a nice goal to have. Good luck with your test tomorrow!\n",
      "I bet it is. Now you can relax a bit.\n",
      "thats really awesome to have a friend for that long especially in today's world where friends come and go so fast \n",
      "Yes he does. Hopefully he learns from this.\n",
      "Yeah, everyone has their own path in life. Just focus on your own success.\n",
      "You got this, just stay confident!\n",
      "Well atleast you were loyal to your friend. He deserved to lose her over something like that.\n",
      "Atleast you can still use it now that its clean.\n",
      "True, but kids want the name brand stuff.\n",
      "That is a cute name, he must love you very much.\n",
      "Its nice to have a moment of peace and quiet. Rare these days. \n",
      "But if you do, they won't learn how to solve problems on their own. That's how they become independent adults.\n",
      "that's great for her and for your family. more money never hurts.\n",
      "Poor guy, I hope he feels better soon.\n",
      "Probably not necessary. She will probaby forget about it.\n",
      "I would be furious. I would talk to your boss about it.\n",
      "I would be too worried about that!  Hopefully you won't! \n",
      "Oh no...sorry for your loss\n",
      "Oh wow, I would have been scared if I saw that. Did the bird survive?\n",
      "That could be a good way to meet new friends! Maybe there are some other moms that are in the same boat as you are.\n",
      "yeah i don't get it either. parents need to parent! not be their friend\n",
      "That is terrible. I am sorry for her loss.\n",
      "That's great! I bet you are excited to have him around more.\n",
      "Well that shows you care atleast. Tupperware is expensive.\n",
      "That is great! What kind of award is it?\n",
      "I know but starting a new job is always nerve wracking!\n",
      "Oh my gosh! What kind of bug was it?\n",
      "Maybe you should try and spend some time with her again!\n",
      "No but it sounds less nerve wracking. Congrats on getting the job!\n",
      "That's disgusting. Kids will be kids, but the parents should still watch them a bit better.\n",
      "Then maybe you need to communicate with them differently? Like shout louder? lol\n",
      "That's great that you were still able to have some quality time together. I'm sure she appreciated it. I try to do things like that with my sister when I can get her to slow down and enjoy being with me.\n",
      "I can imagine it being very emotional. I have two kids and they changed my life for the better.\n",
      "I've always wanted to go to California. Have you been before?\n",
      "Poor dog. Did you get her clean?\n",
      "Sounds like a plan! Get some good rest.\n",
      "How do you think it went?\n",
      "I can imagine. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.\n",
      "Being faithful to people?\n",
      "thank you for nothing?\n",
      "Wow that is terrible to go through. I am glad you have a close family to lean on during tough times like that.\n",
      "okay then, thanks anyways?\n",
      "For what? Going to garden?\n",
      "Exactly, and going with it usually works out\n",
      "I hope they do listen to you and make it right.\n",
      "oh okay why were you distraught?\n",
      "Oh cool, which association was it?\n",
      "I know what you mean, I hate being alone.\n",
      "I would wait as long as I had to to get my favorite food!\n",
      "That's great, I wish I had access to swimming pools all year round. I live in an apartment with no gym.\n",
      "Birthday surprises are the best.\n",
      "Oh okay, how long does she usually stay with them?\n",
      "Of course! Losing a parent is never easy. \n",
      "That is great, a boy to raise up and teach how to be a man\n",
      "That is great to hear, it shows you have a strong relationship!\n",
      "Exactly! Work hard for what you want!\n",
      "Yes, it is not always easy to be positive when things are tough but it is so important to try!\n",
      "atleast shes resting and getting some restorative sleep i guess.\n",
      "That is very positive of you\n",
      "my daughter loves to sing too shes 6\n",
      "Telling him now gives you both a chance at happiness instead of living a lie\n",
      "thats good, do you have experience in that field?\n",
      "You can use this time to do the things that you like, to discover new hobbies, to travel, to meet new people, to grow as a person, I am sure that you will find many things to do\n",
      "Well atleast he forgave you, everyone makes mistakes.\n",
      "just one cheat day a week is ok! you got this! \n",
      "That's great he can provide for your family\n",
      "Yeah but atleast with the barking dog you can block out the noise with some white noise or music. With my neighbors its hard to block out because its right next to my window. \n",
      "Maybe someone stole it\n",
      "aww that will be so special for them to meet their grandson :) are they flying out to see you?\n",
      "At least you have something to look forward to coming home to!\n",
      "Managements never care about that stuff. Did you atleast get some sleep after that?\n",
      "Well at least she didn't make a big deal about it.\n",
      "Have you tried reaching out to her and seeing if she wants to come home early\n",
      "exactly. and once you do that. you are unstoppable\n",
      "That's so sweet! I bet you were surprised.\n",
      "Prayer is very comforting\n",
      "No, I haven't yet. But I'm thinking about it more and more each day. What's holding you back?\n",
      "That is a great way to live life, spreading happiness is contagious \n",
      "Have you tried joining any online gaming communities? That may be a way to meet people with similar interests.\n",
      "Yes I was going to say how excited you must be\n",
      "that sounds like fun\n",
      "Maybe she just didnt like your wife for some reason\n",
      "Oh wow that is nice of her! I would have kept it for sure.\n",
      "My name is Mike what about you?\n",
      "I'm glad to hear that!  What did you do today?\n",
      "Just find some hobbies to do by yourself to keep your mind off of it. Maybe join a sports league or something.\n",
      "Ah gotcha, maybe clean more often then?\n",
      "I hope you get it! What kind of job is it?\n",
      "Maybe you can join some clubs or something to meet new people.\n",
      "At least you have the dogs to keep you company.  Maybe make some new friends at work?\n",
      "Oh wow, that is annoying when people do that. Did anything happen after you argued with him?\n",
      "I would have felt terrible if I did that.\n",
      "I know exactly what you mean, I feel that way about my childhood home.\n",
      "I bet it is fun to see them grow and develop their own likes and dislikes!\n",
      "That would be stressful to be around!\n",
      "yeah sundays they are closed here in texas unfortunately\n",
      "that's awesome hopefully you get the job then!\n",
      "Maybe you were just excited that your dog looked so similar to another dog\n",
      "<<|assistant|>\n",
      "Happens sometimes when you have a unique looking dog breed\n",
      "Why would the mailman be mad at you for that?\n",
      "I hope everything comes back clear for you.\n",
      "Those are such great memories to have. I miss being a kid sometimes.\n",
      "They will be proud of you when you get a career.\n",
      "That's a good way to look at it. As long as you're not hurting anyone else for your beliefs then more power to you.\n",
      "I know how you feel. I've been looking for a while too. Just keep your head up and keep applying! Something will come along!\n",
      "Oh no i wasn't envious of his promotion at all.  I was happy for him actually.  He deserved it.\n",
      "That is nice of you to do that, does he have any toys?\n",
      "Exactly. It's a slippery slope though. Where do you draw the line? Is it ever okay to steal?\n",
      "Kids have a way of teaching us important life lessons.\n",
      "Oh my god, that's terrible. I'm so sorry for your loss. Did you get a chance to say goodbye?\n",
      "Pediatrician.\n",
      "That is really impressive, she should be proud of herself.\n",
      "I can understand how seeing someone less fortunate can put things into perspective. Maybe it's time to look for a new job?\n",
      "That's really nice of him! I wouldn't have known what to do with a tree that big!\n",
      "Ohhhh.Who is she??I wont say her name if you dont want me to.I know a few female singers like that.Manipulative yes.But famous yes.\n",
      "It really did, now it seems like rain clouds follow me everywhere. Haha. But at least I have memories to look back on and smile about.\n",
      "Haha, that's a weird thing to do. Did you file a police report?\n",
      "I hope they do find them and they pay to replace your mail box\n",
      "She would just ignore it and let us fight it out. She wouldnt take sides.\n",
      "Keep your head up, something will come along.\n",
      "That is so embarrassing! I would have been so mad! Did anyone come to your defense?\n",
      "Aww well at least she's being affectionate. Maybe invest in a face mask to filter out the hair?\n",
      "Oh wow! Never been to Somalia before. Will be an adventure for sure!\n",
      "Oh wow, that is sad, but you can still say sorry to her family if you can find them.\n",
      "Oh wow, I didn't know that could cause toilet clogs too.\n",
      "Oh nice! I used to play chess when I was younger. \n",
      "Exactly, I don't mind talking about myself for a little bit but then I want to know about the other person. \n",
      "At least you know it is on its way.\n",
      "Always stay positive and don't let anyone bring you down no matter what they do\n",
      "That's awesome, friends like that are hard to come by. I'm glad y'all reconnected.\n",
      "Did the dog not mind being ridden like that?\n",
      "At least you can learn from the first try and do better next time\n",
      "Maybe try calling her neighbor to see if they can contact her for you?\n",
      "I agree, but I still try to be happy with what I have. \n",
      "At least you have a job there. Maybe you can find another one soon.\n",
      "About what? Being faithful? Not necessarily, but I try to be.\n",
      "Wow that's really nice of her! Friends like that are hard to come by\n",
      "I bet it takes a lot of practice to get good at it. I bet that kid had been skateboarding for years.\n",
      "It would make you feel better about yourself too.\n",
      "Just let him cry it out\n",
      "That is good that nothing bad happened. I would have been really upset if something did.\n",
      "Yes! And some of them just never get it! My last rescue never did!\n",
      "I just ignore him and do my job the best I can. Hopefully one day he will be gone.\n",
      "Ah gotcha, yea kids change so much in that amount of time! I'm sure next time you see her baby she'll be a whole new person!\n",
      "Oh my goodness, that sounds incredible!  I bet that was such an amazing experience!\n",
      "Oh no! That's too bad. I'm sure you'll meet someone better soon! \n",
      "Good.  Glad he is better.\n",
      "I try not to let it get to me. Easier said than done though.\n",
      "Yes seeing my kids happy makes me happy\n",
      "That sounds like a really great position! I hope you get it!\n",
      "That was a good idea.  Giving her the day to process it.\n",
      "yeah i grew up in Anaheim so we went all the time, used to be able to go after dark and stay all night, now its not even open past 9pm.\n",
      "Nice.  What kind is he looking at?\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. What do you have that requires disability?\n",
      "yes i can imagine that getting annoying after a while\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully she's getting better.\n",
      "Yes it is, and it feels so good when you finally achieve something after working hard for it. \n",
      "They should have been shut down.\n",
      "Oh cool! She is brave. I would be scared to do that.\n",
      "Haha. I bet you ran back in the house to get them.\n",
      "They really should! Especially during busy times of the day they need more help working the registers.\n",
      "Absolutely. And they grow up so fast. Before you know it, they're not a puppy anymore. Cherish those first few months!\n",
      "I know what you mean, adulthood is stressful.\n",
      "I've heard that a lot. do you have any favorite brand for labels/bins?\n",
      "Haha that's really interesting! I bet you did a lot of research for that.\n",
      "You could always call them or send a text message if email is not working\n",
      "Just let them cry a little bit. They grow out of it.\n",
      "Maybe you guys just needed to take a breather and cool off before continuing the discussion?\n",
      "That sounds like an amazing adventure! I would love to travel to Hong Kong someday.\n",
      "I love vacations but dont get to go on them often enough\n",
      "Yeah, I did learn a lot from it! I realized that I should have applied to more fellowships and not just settled for one that I wasn't sure I would get into.\n",
      "Those are the best memories to hold onto forever\n",
      "I would have been mad too if my wife did that to me.\n",
      "that sucks for you guys\n",
      "Thats really cool! He will do well in that field.\n",
      "Yes I do, a daughter who is 6 years old.  She has had her fair share of doctor visits as well unfortunately.\n",
      "Haha I remember those! My cousins used to collect them.\n",
      "Haha, she's learning to be independent at a young age. I'm sure you'll be giving her an allowance soon enough. \n",
      "Good that she apologized. People can be mean for no reason.\n",
      "Did you take the baby rat to a vet?\n",
      "That had to be so scary not knowing what was going on with her!\n",
      "Aww that's sweet, I bet it was hungry too.\n",
      "Oh my god! Did you make it back safe?\n",
      "8 years old doing what? getting married? having a baby? what happened?\n",
      "Exactly, you never know what is going on behind closed doors. Maybe she is struggling financially and is just trying to live life while she can before things get bad.\n",
      "Yes. I exercise every day to stay healthy. What do you do to stay healthy?\n",
      "Oh wow! Are you having a hard time waiting?\n",
      "That is great that you are doing some research on it. I am sure that will help you stick to it.\n",
      "That is so exciting. A boy for you to raise into a man.\n",
      "Oh no! Did he get you something else you didn't want?\n",
      "That is great to hear, you should be proud of yourself\n",
      "You are very disciplined! I could never do that.\n",
      "It's a healthier option than whole milk.\n",
      "yeah driving is stressful\n",
      "I can imagine.   I hope he gets back on track soon.\n",
      "Atleast you had something to look forward to.\n",
      "Ohh I see! I forgot it was your anniversary! What a sweet husband you have!\n",
      "Yikes, I can imagine that was embarrassing. Did she say anything?\n",
      "Did you kill it with a club?\n",
      "Wow that must have been really stressful but in the end it was worth it for the new life you created\n",
      "Thatâ€™s amazing! Iâ€™m so glad everything worked out for you and your little guy!\n",
      "She had a good long life with you. You gave her a great home.\n",
      "Ohh I see, so you were jealous?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess it depends on your financial situation, but I'm very grateful my parents were able to help me some with college\n",
      "I can imagine how much fun that was for you then!\n",
      "Have a relative watch the baby for a few days while you go somewhere with your spouse\n",
      "Yeah I've noticed that when I drink more water my skin looks better too.\n",
      "Oh no. Did you still wear it to prom?\n",
      "Yes! I loved Sonic the Hedgehog on my Game Gear! Such good times.\n",
      "Wow, that would have scared me! Did you find out what it was?\n",
      "she will be great artist in future.\n",
      "Gone wrong how exactly?\n",
      "That is so sweet! I bet you are so happy you found her and she is happy to have a loving home.\n",
      "Wow, that's impressive! Where did she go?\n",
      "Right. You never know how bad it could have been. Glad it missed your home.\n",
      "That is really sweet of him to use family heirlooms. I am so happy for him and your future sister in law!\n",
      "Those are really popular right now. I have a friend with one and loves it.\n",
      "Thats enough time,dont wait till the last moment.\n",
      "I know right? I've had to have family ship me things from the US because of this exact issue\n",
      "Wow. That is a long time to hold onto anger. Did she ever apologize?\n",
      "Yeah car repairs can be so unexpected and expensive.  At least it is fixed now.\n",
      "Yes, my youngest is 21 and my oldest is 25. It's crazy how fast they grew up! \n",
      "Wow. That's really disappointing. I hope you find somewhere else soon.\n",
      "Did what make her not like it?\n",
      "That is awesome a boy coming into the world\n",
      "That must have been a relief that you didn't have to miss work, but also stressful that you couldn't go see your child.\n",
      "The club as in a night club?\n",
      "Knew what she was doing doing what!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!\n",
      "That is a good work ethic to have, how far off is the baby due?\n",
      "A secret about what?\n",
      "Oh you were homeless? Why were you homeless?\n",
      "Maybe you should have a \"get ready day\" where you do all that again to boost your confidence! :)\n",
      "it would break you if you didnt tell her and continued the relationship, you need to do the right thing! \n",
      "Its hard to deal with... cherish the memories you have though. \n",
      "Family should always be proud of their kids accomplishments!  :) \n",
      "i bet not.. but they probably didnt find out about the lie anyway right?\n",
      "yeah.. she plans everything before hand\n",
      "That's great you found a good balance. Having benefits is a huge plus. \n",
      "good for you for staying loyal to your girl. she will appreciate that\n",
      "I understand, give yourself some time to grieve before thinking about getting another one.\n",
      "Did you honk at them or anything? \n",
      "OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\n",
      "No problem, what were you going to say?\n",
      "Oh wow! I have never heard of that game before! Good luck on the exam!\n",
      "I hope you meet someone better.\n",
      "Haha. At least you had pants to change into.\n",
      "Who is coming? Is it a friend?\n",
      "Oh no, that would be so awkward if you had to go poop next to your crush! Maybe you should try to hold it until you get home.\n",
      "where?\n",
      "happens to the best of us\n",
      "good for you\n",
      "i hope you do well!\n",
      "I love elephants, they are so big.\n",
      "About what exactly?\n",
      "Oh wow that is something to be happy about! Where is your old house located?\n",
      "yea i had help too\n",
      "Oh cool! What kind of car do you race?\n",
      "Wow that is amazing!  Congratulations on your new home!\n",
      "Wow, that is a really nice car! What color is it?\n",
      "She really paid attention to what you wanted! That is so sweet of her!\n",
      "I know that feeling! But you will find something great!\n",
      "Oh no, who is she? Your significant other?\n",
      "Definitely not! I would have told the manager how unpleasant it was.\n",
      "yes very close, they have passed but i still visit their house often\n",
      "Memories are the best. They make life so special. \n",
      "That sounds amazing!!  I bet the weather will be perfect too!!\n",
      "Yes, my house was fine too thankfully! Just no power for a week though!\n",
      "What kind of testing did they want to do?\n",
      "No but I want to build one with my kids one day\n",
      "I am sorry for your loss. She was a good woman I am sure.\n",
      "Wow. What a jerk. I would have demanded to see a different doctor\n",
      "I bet you will do great! Database stuff is my favorite.\n",
      "Did you still go get brunch with her?\n",
      "No, but I would love to go someday\n",
      "Ohh I see what you mean now! I thought it was a locket with a key inside haha.\n",
      "Oh no.. that sucks.. did you at least get some sodas?\n",
      "Are you going to confront him about it\n",
      "I think you should. If they love you they will want to make you feel better and included.\n",
      "That is wonderful timing for a raise to come through.\n",
      "Its completely normal to feel that way, just try not to let it bother you next time. Its out of your control.\n",
      "Money is always nice but loyalty is priceless sometimes\n",
      "well atleast she thought of you.. some grandparents dont even do that\n",
      "Yes they are, nature can be quite scary at times.\n",
      "I enjoy being outdoors\n",
      "Well good luck keeping it a secret!  She will love it!\n",
      "i think if you didn't want to lead him on...telling him the truth would have been worse. At least he knows now that you weren't interested instead of finding out down the road.\n",
      "That is really creepy. Did the police get involved?\n",
      "Well hopefully they are just kidding around with you about it\n",
      "oh man! poor you! i would have had to hold it the rest of the trip!!! lolol\n",
      "return it and buy it legitimately next time you get paid\n",

      "I hope you did get the job! That would be great news.\n",

      "Haha yes multiple bags.\n",
      "Family is usually understanding. Glad she was.\n",
      "Thats a big topic to teach kids about!  How did they take it?\n",
      "Yeah I bet.  But you will get used to the quiet and maybe meet someone better soon.  Don't dwell on the past too much.\n",
      "Wow!  Sounds boring but important!  I bet you are really good at your job.  I would mess up all the numbers.  LOL\n",
      "oh my god that is insane  did the police catch him?\n",

      "That's too bad. What did you study for?\n",
      "Exactly, I was without mine for about a week and had to go buy a cooler to keep food fresh. Atleast its fixed now I hope!\n",
      "Maybe he worked really hard to get there.\n",
      "Are you prepared for a baby financially?\n",
      "At least you can study for something else in the meantime.\n",

      "that sucks. Hope you get some help soon\n",

      "Well, at least she didn't embarrass you by laughing at the time!\n",
      "That is the best thing to do when you are upset. Just walk away from the situation.\n",

      "Oh cool, I have an old Nintendo but not a Sega, I should get one.\n",

      "Those are reliable cars.\n",
      "I remember watching it in theaters when I was 18 as well. It holds up as a good movie.\n",

      "Oh I've never been to Florida! I bet the water is warm this time of year.\n",
      "Yes, I do remember! I worked when I was a teenager to buy my own clothes and things I wanted. Gives you a sense of responsibility too!\n",

      "what happened?\n",

      "I've never seen that one! Is it any good?\n",
      "Yes she will get some good scholarships hopefully\n",
      "Oh cool I have always wanted a Honda Prelude they look sporty.\n",
      "Wow that is really interesting, do you have a job yet in that field?\n",
      "Perhaps you should sit her down and just tell her how sorry you are and how you plan to make it up to her.  Hopefully she can forgive you.\n",
      "That is always nice to see family you don't get to see often.\n",
      "Maybe you should plan a reunion with all of your old friends.\n",

      "Maybe you can visit him there!\n",
      "Wow that is quite a change from where you are currently living. I am sure it will be an adjustment but I am sure you will like it.\n",
      "That in itself is a mystic experience..  being able to just relax and be happy..  hard to do sometimes!\n",
      "Oh that's good that it was nothing bad!\n",
      "Exactly. It's not just about hurting your feelings, it's hurting business as well.\n",
      "i would have done the same thing. group presentations are a bit easier i think.\n",

      "I'm sorry he had to suffer like that.  At least he was with you until the end.\n",
      "Yes and then you had to wait another 2 weeks for the next one haha. But at least you had money coming in. \n",
      "Ha maybe they are saving money to pay you more\n",
      "That is good that you are moving on and getting over it, time heals all wounds.\n",
      "At least they were not mad at you!\n",
      "I miss those days. They grow up so fast!\n",
      "at least your date didnt run away from you after seeing you fall haha\n",
      "That is very nice of you to make it up to them. Did they forgive you?\n",
      "yes it is hard to deal with. my brother hung himself. it was hard dealing with my parents grief and my own grief at the same time. i couldn't burden my parents either. they already had enough to deal with\n",
      "That sounds like a good job.\n",
      "where did you lose it?\n",
      "not a big milestone birthday, still young though \n",
      "I'm 28 so I was born in the 80s but grew up in the 90s lol. So I remember some of that stuff!\n",
      "That will be so nice to see them again!\n",
      "i have never seen that show before is it funny\n",
      "Well then you should have no problem teaching them.\n",
      "Me too. Especially if its over water.\n",
      "Ah okay. Maybe next time invite her to a party with people she does know.\n",
      "i spend mine inside playing video games thankfully\n",
      "Yes, we did co-ops and playdates with other homeschoolers. My kids still have friends that they see outside of our regular meetings though.\n",
      "Oh wow that sounds like hard work. How long does he usually stay gone for?\n",
      "I saw it for free since my niece wanted to see it. Regretted every second of it.\n",
      "They should at least let you save some of it for yourself. That's not fair.\n",
      "That is NOT ok. He should have told you about it. \n",
      "She got me on that one. It was a Cherry popsicle. I thought it would dissolve before she had to clean it up LOL! But ants are a huge pet peeve of mine too! I would have thrown it out the window if she didn't clean it up first!\n",
      "That is really impressive, what kind of art does she do?\n",
      "That is good that you were able to talk to his father.  Hopefully nothing like that happens again.\n",
      "That does sound pretty rough, does he hate it too?\n",
      "I'm glad you were able to find some peace. Losing a friend is never easy.\n",
      "Yes they can be. I've had some really kind strangers do things for me. Makes you believe in humanity a little more.\n",
      "Yeah savings always needs some extra money added to it!  Enjoy the rest of your summer!\n",
      "I wouldn't want to see that. I would throw up.\n",
      "Oh okay I see what you mean then, he works for a company that gives bonuses.\n",
      "then you will be even more alone :( maybe get a pet to keep you company.\n",
      "Mine was a small one with family and friends.I did not expect one.\n",
      "I know exactly what you mean.  My oldest is in college now.  It goes by so fast. \n",
      "Atleast you were prepared then. Power outages happen often where I live so we always have candles on hand.\n",
      "Yes, you don't want to get in the middle of something you don't understand. Stay safe.\n",
      "Thats sad.. Atleast he is in peace now..\n",
      "That is great! Congratulations! What kind of job is it?\n",
      "You should. If she cheated on you with your friend, she's not loyal and doesn't deserve you.\n",
      "thats great. i love going to the beach with my family.\n",
      "Nice work studying hard pays off\n",
      "Jealousy is a terrible trait to have. I would talk to your boss about it.\n",
      "I agree he should, I would love to see it live one day\n",
      "Thats unfortunate.. Did you tip the cab driver well? haha\n",
      "Well try to just be yourself and everything should be fine. They will like you if she likes you.\n",
      "Yeah.. I would have been mad if i were you. but i guess letting it go was the best thing to do.\n",
      "Oh cats can be annoying sometimes. But they are cute.\n",
      "That's awesome, what does he want to do now?\n",
      "That must have been so hard. Did you at least have friends to lean on?\n",
      "Wow!  That is really impressive for such a young age!\n",
      "That's great that everything turned out well. \n",
      "That's so romantic! Congrats to you both!\n",
      "Oh well then its understandable she would want it back... maybe you can get your daughter something similar so she has her own special necklace too.\n",
      "That is great to have a good boss. Most bosses are not very nice.\n",
      "That must have been so cool.\n",
      "Maybe you should go to bed later.\n",
      "did you get to choose some of the colors for the inside? that is always fun picking out paint colors.\n",
      "Oh no. Is she okay?\n",
      "Kids don't understand time management :(\n",
      "That's amazing!  Mine drew me pregnant even though I'm not!  Ha ha  She must have a good memory of me to draw all those features!\n",
      "Ah they procrastinate alot huh.. kids these days..\n",
      "I know the feeling of wanting to get out of a job i hate, i hope you find a good one soon\n",
      "thats always nice to look back on the old times. \n",
      "That is too bad, does he not have any contact with you at all?\n",
      "That shows a lot of initiative and will to get the job.  I'm sure they'll see that.\n",
      "Aww that is too bad! I love ice cream cake!\n",
      "10 years is a long time.. does she have a reason for leaving?\n",
      "No, we are still important. But as people get busy with their own lives, they forget about our special days.\n",
      "Wow! That sounds like a really interesting job. When do you start?\n",
      "Oh my god that would have scared me!! Did you kill it??\n",
      "Yes, overcoming fears can be difficult but important to do.  Glad you did.\n",
      "I bet it saved you money doing it yourself!\n",
      "Yeah i would have been mad too. Did you get a good grade on the paper?\n",
      "Really?  What store was it?\n",
      "I hope the professor did something about it.  She should not have been able to get away with it.\n",
      "I love fixing up old houses.  It gives them character.\n",
      "nice! a classic car to save up for!\n",
      "No I don't think I would either.  Those times are in the past for a reason.  But it is nice to have the music take you back.\n",
      "They do that sometimes when they want attention.\n",
      "Maybe you can plan a day to go again soon?\n",
      "That's great - I'm sure all your hard work will pay off tomorrow. Good luck!\n",
      "That is great that she wants to grow up. Potty training can be hard.\n",
      "Its hard being away from the one you love.\n",
      "Pets are like family. Its hard losing them.\n",

      "what does she do that makes you proud?\n",
      "did he do it on purpose or was it an accident?\n",
      "I understand that!  Just go in there with confidence and you will do great!\n",
      "Glad to hear that they were taken care of.\n",
      "Yeah i have been playing alot of video games too! Its the only thing that keeps my mind off of missing them! Do you have any good game recommendations?\n",
      "Yes i am sure you are\n",
      "Have you visited there before?\n",
      "I would hate to be left with extra work when others bail on a task.\n",
      "I love movies about aliens, i'll watch it as soon as possible\n",

      "Maybe one day you will get the chance to move there, you never know what the future holds!\n",
      "Yes it would have been stressful to not have a caterer lined up\n",

      "Yeah hopefully mine will get better. She is going through a lot right now.\n",
      "I see. Well maybe try rewarding him for a good week of sleep schedule. Like a video game or something.\n",
      "She was very surprised I bet, did she enjoy it?\n",

      "At least you have something to watch on another device in the meantime.\n",
      "about time you stood up for yourself\n",

      "Well at least you can stay inside and drink some beers and play board games instead!\n",
      "Its been really hot here lately.  Glad you got to enjoy good weather.\n",
      "I think we will, it just takes time and people having more conversations about their beliefs instead of just yelling at each other.\n",
      "Oh wow, I'm so sorry to hear that.  Losing a sibling and then a parent would be very hard.  I hope you are able to find some peace and happiness again someday.\n",
      "Oh wow, I would feel bad for not seeing family when they are in town.\n",
      "Yes! I love Imagine Dragons! They are so good live.\n",

      "I see, I hope this diet works for you then. Fingers crossed!\n",
      "I've only experienced one in my life and it was terrifying. I hope your city has rebuilt since then.\n",
      "That's very sweet of him. He must really love you to do something like that.\n",
      "My mom always went all out for Christmas.  I miss that too.\n",

      "Drama free days are hard to come by.\n",
      "At least he is no longer suffering, but I am sure the grief will take some time to get over. He was a great dog.\n",

      "I understand being nervous about it!  But I am sure you will do great!  Fingers crossed!\n",
      "I just ignore them at this point and do it myself since they won't listen\n",
      "I would have been upset too if I was her age and lost a pet.  They can be like family members to kids.\n",
      "That's terrible. They should have been more careful.\n",
      "that is awesome! bill paying is the worst\n",
      "Yes, that is the beauty of having blessings, to share it with others\n",
      "Oh my gosh! Were you okay?\n",

      "I would get one- Its cheap on amazon and will help catch the person doing this\n",

      "Well that is exciting but also a big change!  I am sure you will adjust though!\n",
      "That's great. Kids need other kids to play with.\n",
      "Ugh that's the worst - I hate waiting rooms! Did they at least give you a reason for the delay?\n",
      "That is so sweet - what did you name him?\n",

      "Good you stood up for yourself\n",
      "Christmas is for giving not just receiving.\n",
      "Atleast no one saw you fall in front of him too much haha\n",
      "Definitely. I am still working on saving.\n",
      "Atleast you were ok though!\n",
      "No it is not. Is there not anything you can do while he is gone to keep your mind off of it?\n",
      "yeah i know my oldest is in college now and its weird seeing him not at home all the time\n",
      "But you aced it anyway!\n",

      "I would be angry too! she needs to end the relationship and face the consequences of her actions.\n",
      "You should have punched him back lol\n",
      "Oh I see, I guess if you've been many times it loses its appeal.\n",
      "Still not bad, you can buy some lottery tickets with it.\n",
      "It's worth a shot. You never know if they are thinking the same thing.\n",
      "At least you have insurance to help you out.  Hopefully they got a ticket so they learn not to speed.\n",
      "dont worry, he will be happy to see you when you come back\n",
      "Yes! Maybe one day! I am proud of you for finishing though! That is amazing!\n",
      "Hard work pays off! Enjoy your new home\n",
      "Yep, been married for 8 years. She is my best friend.\n",
      "Maybe it was a secret admirer?\n",
      "was it an expensive vase?\n",
      "im sure he will be ok.. praying for him\n",
      "Accidents happen, you cant always be watching everything.\n",
      "Yes and how fast they can do it is amazing too\n",
      "yep i remember going there as a kid with my parents to get christmas presents.\n",
      "Toddlers can be very stressful, I am sure she will understand\n",
      "Cheating destroys trust, something very important in a relationship\n",
      "yeah i feel that with my wife and our phones\n",
      "Every generation says that about the music of the previous generation, I guess we just like what we grew up with.\n",
      "That sounds like a lot of fun!  Enjoy your time together\n",
      "True but I would enjoy more time off from work haha\n",
      "Oh nice! I have played the previous FarCry games and enjoyed them. I might have to pick that up as well!\n",
      "Its exciting to me. Thunder and lightning too.\n",
      "I've played that before, not currently though.\n",
      "That is great. HR work can be stressful but rewarding\n",
      "Ugh! I hate when people do that! I like everything to have a home.\n",
      "I would be really angry if I were you. Maybe take some time apart from him to cool off.\n",
      "Definitely a money saver now too! Diapers can be expensive.\n",
      "Puppies are the best! What kind is she?\n",
      "That's not bad at all. I make less than that and I have a master's degree haha\n",
      "Exactly, but little things can still make us feel sad.\n",

      "yeah i visit them once a year if i am lucky\n",
      "At least you were there for him. Hopefully he feels better soon.\n",
      "Pets become part of the family so it's completely understandable to be upset.\n",
      "yeah its always such an inconvenience\n",
      "Maybe it was a gift from someone and you never knew it was missing. Ha ha.\n",
      "I would not be able to sleep knowing there could be more on my wall\n",
      "I'm sure you'll do great! Just remember to breathe and stay calm.\n",
      "Its all about being confident when giving a speech. Fake it til you make it.\n",
      "that is always a good feeling to make some extra cash\n",
      "i agree, honesty is key in any relationship, its how trust is built\n",
      "Keep climbing that corporate ladder. The sky is the limit.\n",
      "Thatâ€™s good at least, some people lose everything.\n",
      "That's ridiculous. I would have complained to the FAA about them. Did you at least get a refund for the delay?\n",
      "Just keep practicing! You'll get the hang of it. Good luck on your next test!\n",
      "That is great! Now you have a bright future ahead of you.\n",

      "Yes it should have been on a leash, were you able to go the next day?\n",
      "Ugh!  Hopefully you have some savings to fall back on until you can fix it\n",
      "People can be so mean sometimes. I hope your insurance covers the damages!\n",
      "I bet it did. I would have liked it too.\n",
      "Oh they were live,that is awesome!what kind of music were they playing?\n",
      "Its always fun to try new things and be good at it!\n",
      "They will do it when you leave haha! Mine does it all the time.\n",
      "Just keep moving forward and youll be fine!\n",
      "Exactly! School is what will get you where you want to be in life\n",
      "I've seen that happen in my city with certain neighborhoods.   Crazy how fast things can change.  \n",
      "Ha ha.  That is funny to think about.\n",
      "Hopefully he takes good care of it!\n",

      "haha maybe they will think there having a party next door.\n",
      "Did you check to see if there was anything there?\n",
      "That will be so special for them!!\n",
      "I always had to go to my grandparents house and it was always stressful.\n",
      "Yes, it can be really discouraging to go through a bunch of interviews and not get any offers!\n",
      "That must have been a relief that it was just your neighbor.\n",
      "A doctor can help you come up with a plan to control it. Good idea!\n",
      "Atleast yours still gets you from point a to point b.\n",
      "Oh wow, I would not do it then. Maybe have a friend meet you there with you? Or have the buyer come to your house if its close enough. Better safe than sorry!\n",
      "Ha!  I am sure you will love it then!  Enjoy your new quiet home!\n",
      "That is horrible! I hope you are able to get your money back and they catch the person who did it.\n",
      "I agree. I am thankful for everything I have.\n",
      "That's very nice of you. They will surely appreciate the handmade gifts. \n",
      "I can imagine. Technology has made it easier now to stay in touch with loved ones far away.\n",

      "Yes I have a cat named Leo, he is pretty needy for attention though haha\n",

      "Nice choices, my brother just got an Xterra too!  He loves it.\n",
      "They are but they are worth it for all the room they have\n",
      "I'm glad no accident happened, some people are reckless on the road.\n",
      "I know what you mean. My oldest is 21 and it feels like just yesterday they were little.\n",
      "Oh wow! Working out always makes you feel better!\n",
      "That's awesome! I love supporting local and organic. It's always better quality.\n",
      "I would have been scared too if that happened to me.\n",
      "Yes he should clean that up before it gets infected.\n",
      "And it would be cheaper than putting them in jail.\n",
      "That's great! I bet that brought back a lot of good feelings.\n",
      "Well done you must be proud of yourself \n",
      "That sounds like a lot of fun, I love going to sports bars and watching games with friends.\n",
      "Yeah they do. It seems like they grow up so fast nowadays. My niece just started kindergarten and it's crazy to think she's in school already.\n",
      "Yes it does and gives you peace of mind knowing you are prepared for the worst.\n",
      "That's impressive, I only know a couple words in spanish.\n",
      "Three weeks? Why would you move after only three weeks?\n",
      "Poor thing! I hope it finds a good home!\n",
      "That is great that she found new hobbies.\n",
      "I used to love watching home shows! I should get Hulu just for that.\n",
      "That is unfortunate.  Hopefully it wasn't someone's pet.\n",
      "I can't imagine how devastating that would be for the parents.\n",
      "It is always nice to have friends that care about you.\n",
      "That sucks. Were you at fault?\n",
      "I hope everything goes well and you come back safe.\n",
      "I agree, it's sad to think about.  I try not to let it get to me too much but it does make me angry when I hear about it.\n",
      "yeah i try to make new memories with my family now\n",
      "That is insane!  I would be eating a lot of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches if I spent that much on eating out.\n",
      "I've always wanted to visit Texas.\n",
      "That's good. I hate having to leave my home.\n",
      "Family is the best! They are the ones that love you no matter what.\n",
      "No, I can imagine it wasn't. I have gotten into fights with my father as well when I was younger.\n",
      "Oh wow, I hope everything goes smoothly then.\n",
      "At least you got some good time with her before she passed.\n",
      "That is great that someone stopped to help! Were you far from civilization?\n",
      "I know that feeling. Moving always seems to take longer than you think it will.\n",
      "I might have to give it a try\n",
      "Yes, that is rare! Enjoy your life together!\n",
      "Those are some good old songs! I love Mambo #5!\n",
      "Are you a good test taker?\n",
      "That is awesome! I am so happy for him!\n",
      "I'm actually in Texas! I'll have to look into going somewhere close by.\n",
      "Haha I love that. Boy Scouts taught me a lot about being prepared. I guess some people just aren't prepared to appreciate that!\n",
      "I can imagine how disappointed you were!  I would have been upset too!\n",
      "I agree. I would rather get a burger for that price.\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. Did you have him for a long time?\n",
      "Ah gotcha, so you can give him a nice surprise when he shows up.\n",
      "I am sure it was. You must be very proud of yourself.\n",
      "oh cool what language is she learning?\n",
      "Yeah exactly, little things like that go a long way to keep the love flowing.\n",
      "Just tell people you are trying a new hairstyle, that is what my wife did.\n",
      "That is too bad. I hate when that happens. Did you tell the manager?\n",
      "I would have ran away if I were you haha. At least it wasnt something expensive.\n",
      "She'll be home soon though :)\n",
      "I went to san diego. It was nice there.\n",
      "Wow that sounds terrifying! I've only had the feeling of being watched but not seen anything.\n",
      "Yeah driving long distances can be tiring so breaking it up into days is a good idea.  I have done a few road trips like that.\n",
      "That's good to hear. At least it wasn't anything serious. I hope she's back to her normal self soon.\n",
      "Did you have any friends you could have hung out with?\n",
      "Oh wow, that is a big surgery. I can understand why you would be nervous. But if her doctor is recommending it, then I would trust their judgement. Maybe you could try to voice your concerns to her doctor as well. But ultimately it is her decision and her health.\n",
      "I can imagine. I hate losing at anything competitive. It makes you want to practice more and come out on top next time.\n",
      "Wow that's amazing news, that's something to really be excited about!\n",
      "i would be devestated! my dog is my child basically. :( \n",
      "What is he getting treated for? Hopefully nothing too serious!\n",
      "Oh interesting, what kind of roller coasters were you working on?\n",
      "That's good! When will she be home?\n",
      "Family is so important!\n",
      "That is a long time, they must be looking forward to seeing you too.\n",
      "oh ok, im not too bad with them but they do creep me out a bit\n",
      "I bet you were very surprised and happy! \n",
      "I would talk to your parents about it and see if they can help stop the behavior.\n",
      "Probably was, sorry that happened to you.\n",
      "Good they did the right thing!\n",
      "Oh well atleast it wasn't something good then, he probably ate it while he was hungry.\n",
      "What was the gift?\n",
      "Yeah she's been with me for almost a year now.  She's a great dog.\n",
      "What did you do about that lol did you stop him?\n",
      "That is impressive! He must be really smart.\n",
      "I bet all your hard work is paying off!\n",
      "No problem! I'm sure you'll do great! Just remember that everyone there is probably just as nervous as you are, so they won't judge you for being quiet if you need to be!\n",
      "I bet it was exciting going down that far.\n",
      "Ha! That's a great mental exercise to get you through the workout. What kind of music do you listen to normally?\n",
      "Yeah I bet it was, thankfully no one was seriously hurt in either of our accidents\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. Losing loved ones is never easy. \n",
      "They figure if they take just a little bit each month, you won't notice! But you did! Good for you!\n",
      "I am so sorry to hear that.  I lost a close friend to suicide a few years ago.  It is a hard thing to deal with.  Are you getting any help to deal with the grief?\n",
      "Ah yes, puppies can be a pain to train. Mine took a while to get it down.\n",
      "Fridge raiders always get to the good stuff first.\n",
      "Good! Atleast you owned up to it. I hope he didnt get too mad at you.\n",
      "Accidents happen, you'll find a way to replace it. Maybe your landlord will be understanding.\n",
      "Thatâ€™â€”s really special, I bet you looked through it for a while.\n",
      "Me too!! I would have been so bummed if we had to cancel.\n",
      "that sucks, maybe next time you can find people to go with you.\n",
      "Oh wow! That sounds like quite the performance. I bet he was quite the rockstar back in his day.\n",
      "Oh my god.  That had to be disgusting.\n",
      "Maybe you need to buy him a bigger sock box.\n",
      "He deserved to lose your friendship over it.\n",
      "That's good that it looks healthier now! I bet it was a big change for you.\n",
      "Probably quite a few.  I would have noticed if I was around you.  Did you have to buy new pants?\n",
      "That is false advertising at best and a scam at worst. I would have contacted eBay and reported the seller.\n",
      "That is great! Chemistry can be a hard class.\n",
      "You are always welcome to talk to me if you need someone to listen.\n",
      "That is good to hear\n",
      "me too i love buying gifts for people i don't get to buy gifts for often\n",
      "oh man! someone always has to win when you are losing!\n",
      "I would try to stay on the bottom floor if possible\n",
      "Just be yourself and everything will be fine.\n",
      "I am sure you will do great though.\n",
      "Maybe he wants attention or is hungry again.\n",
      "That's awesome! What are you studying?\n",
      "Nice, how long will you be staying?\n",
      "Hahahaha that must have been embarrassing.\n",
      "Oh wow, that would have been an adventure.  I bet you were disappointed he bailed on you.  At least you made it halfway though!\n",
      "oof, that never gets easier does it!\n",
      "Haha.  I bet you're having nightmares.  I wouldn't be able to sleep either.\n",
      "I would have pulled over too if it was me\n",
      "Oh wow, you stole candy? Did you feel guilty?\n",
      "Oh no, I hope you were able to get the items back or report him to the police.\n",
      "Wow, I bet that helped a lot with productivity\n",
      "Is it worth it?  I bet you sleep so much better!\n",
      "That is so fun to go to a festival!\n",
      "Well next time just crank your music to drown out theirs.\n",
      "That's ridiculous. I would have switched banks right then and there. I hate when they do that kind of stuff.\n",
      "thats so sweet!!. Im glad you got to relive those moments again\n",
      "Maybe it is nothing.\n",
      "Aww man thats bad luck\n",
      "That sounds like a nice way to spend the day together. At least she didn't have to be out in pain.\n",
      "true i guess if it was a snake or something it would have been more exciting hahaha\n",
      "Ah gotcha, so you were testing your strength then?\n",
      "Thinking about the future maybe?\n",
      "that is a nice win, where do you want to travel to?\n",
      "i have never seen that movie.\n",
      "That's a pretty name. Is she a certain breed?\n",
      "Yes they were!! Music was so much better too!!\n",
      "I bet it does, but it will be so worth it with all the love it gives back!\n",
      "Well hopefully you can find another toupee and impress her.\n",
      "Yuck, I would have ran out of the room at that point.\n",
      "Oh wow. That's too bad. She'll find something else\n",
      "I would have been so scared!\n",
      "Well at least you can learn from the experience for next time.\n",
      "Ewww! How did it get there? Did you have to replace anything?\n",
      "Did your car get damaged?\n",
      "Oh wow, you must be giving a speech about defeating evil then!\n",
      "i would have let them cut in line too if i was there\n",
      "I think that's a good sign that you know the material well enough to remember the answers even if you don't understand how to do the problems.\n",
      "I know, my family just got an instax camera so we can take physical photos again, it's brought back so many memories.\n",
      "Ah cool! I've only been to a couple of games in my life. The stadiums are huge!\n",
      "Ewww. I would have had to wear a mask and burn everything. Poor guy having to go through that with you.\n",
      "At least your car is okay.  Insurance will go up but at least no one was hurt.\n",
      "Oh nice! I have driven one of those before and it was fun.\n",
      "That is amazing, congratulations! What program is it?\n",
      "Good, sleep is important when studying. Did you do well on the exams?\n",
      "That's great! I would have been so upset if I lost everything that was in there.\n",
      "Well maybe I am lying then. But I do try to be generous when I can be. I gave my friend $500 for his birthday too.\n",
      "Wow that's amazing, she must have worked really hard to be able to do that after being in leg braces for so long.\n",
      "I understand that. Maybe you can plan a vacation then when you do get some time off.\n",
      "That is great.  Electrical Engineering is a good field to be in.\n",
      "That is frustrating, maybe you can look into a different company for pick-up?\n",
      "What?! That's disgusting! Did you eat any of it?\n",
      "Wow, I hope it stays clear then. Fingers crossed for her.\n",
      "Wow, that's terrible. I hope he didn't divorce her over it.\n",
      "yes it does, maybe talk to them and let them know how you feel\n",
      "Yes exactly. They bring back the childhood memories when there was no stress of the adult life and only happiness and fun was there\n",
      "That is awesome!  I hope you can try a lot of new beers!\n",
      "yea, she should not look at anyone else but you, she is your property lol\n",
      "Yeah, he seemed like a really interesting person with a lot of drive\n",
      "I bet it did! Surprises are the best.\n",
      "Yes..it is..and they are so grateful!\n",
      "Oh wow! That's really cool! What language is she learning?\n",
      "Maybe he will miss you ?\n",
      "I would be upset if I was in your situation. Maybe you should talk to your boss about it.\n",
      "Atleast they know not to mess with you anymore.\n",
      "Transportation is a good field to get into, he will have a lot of job security.\n",
      "Soup always hits the spot on a nice day like this! Enjoy your lunch!\n",
      "That's good it worked out for you though! At least you got the job. I hope your brother gets one soon, he deserves it after school. Fingers crossed for him\n",
      "Oh no!  I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe they can take you with them on their trips.\n",
      "I'm happy for you both! Long distance relationships are tough.\n",
      "At least you got the job and it worked out for you in the end. That is what is important.\n",
      "At least you have your dogs to keep you company.\n",
      "Cool, did you get the job?\n",
      "yeah parents can be pretty unfair sometimes with favoritism towards one child over the other\n",
      "that will be nice to have her back home again\n",
      "Haha I would have done the same thing!\n",
      "I put bug spray on to try and avoid them\n",
      "No, because they are harmless most of the time.\n",
      "I bet it will be a lot of fun though\n",
      "Ewwwww! I would have thrown it away for sure! At least it wasn't food or drink that you drank out of.. That would have been even worse!\n",
      "I would be too but I am sure they do this surgery all the time and it will all go smoothly. Just trust your doctor!\n",
      "Friends like that are hard to come by. Hang onto her.\n",
      "Oh man that is embarrassing, I have had that happen before where I accidentally played a video while in public.\n",
      "German Shepherds are cool dogs.  What have you named it?\n",
      "That is so sad. I am sure she will feel better knowing she is no longer in pain. Give her some extra love and hugs.\n",
      "Did you go with them?\n",
      "They play music really loud.  And argue a lot.  I'm ready to move too!\n",
      "Haha, at least you have the dogs to keep you company! I just had tv shows to watch while mine was gone.\n",
      "Oh wow, I hate bugs. What kind was it?\n",
      "That's a long time to prepare, you should be ready to crush it!\n",
      "yes keep grinding and you will get there\n",
      "I hope you have a great time when you go!\n",
      "That should help a lot. I wish you the best of luck with your new place.\n",
      "No atleast you caught it early! :P \n",
      "oh wow i would have been creeped out too, i would have thought something was going on lol\n",
      "That will be a happy reunion, what breed is he?\n",
      "Yes it does! My niece just started preschool and I can't believe how fast she's growing up.\n",
      "Small weddings are the best because you can focus on each other more\n",
      "Ha, maybe buy some fake poop and leave it on their yard?\n",
      "That's great to hear, it's always good when people find their calling in life!\n",
      "Poor dog, she must have been hungry. Did you end up getting the mess cleaned up?\n",
      "That's too bad, I hate when restaurants don't live up to the hype.\n",
      "haha yea sometimes when you drink its hard to control yourself\n",
      "Its understandable to not want to argue about beliefs. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion\n",
      "Awww that's so sweet! He sounds like a great husband.\n",
      "Pets become part of the family so it is understandable to still feel sadness about it.\n",
      "At least you can visit him when you go see him at his new job.\n",
      "I am sorry for your loss.\n",
      "That's good. At least, she had a good excuse. And, she made it up to you. Sounds like you two worked through it.\n",
      "Oh no! Was she okay? Did she need to go to the vet? Poor thing. I would have been so upset. I love my cat to death, she's like my little kid.\n",
      "Yeah, it's hard to motivate ourselves to exercise, but it's so important for our health. I'm glad you're doing physical therapy though, and I hope you're able to get back to playing golf again soon!\n",
      "That's a great reason to go skydiving! I'm glad you got to do it and that your mom is doing well.\n",
      "What has been your favorite movie to watch so far?\n",
      "Haha. Poor husband. I am sure he was confused.\n",
      "Oh wow, that's a big deal then. I hope you get it too. Just remember to be confident and don't sell yourself short. You got this!\n",
      "How did she respond?\n",
      "i love playing with dogs\n",
      "I know how that is, but atleast you can veg out during naps! Ha ha\n",
      "Well at least you can buy it eventualy. \n",
      "Just try to make up for it by exercising more. At least you can control that part.\n",
      "That should help him feel better\n",
      "Maybe you should try to find them and have a reunion?\n",
      "I guess so, I've only played it once in my life and it was really boring haha, but each to their own!\n",
      "Yes I would have been angry too, no one should talk bad about someone else's child.\n",
      "oh my god! i would have never thought it was bird bones! that is disgusting that your cat is doing that!\n",
      "Yes!!! they should not be allowed to walk among civilized society if they can't even show basic compassion to animals. \n",
      "Ugh, raccoons are the worst. They always get into our trash too.\n",
      "Thats very nice of you, hopefully he pays you back soon.\n",
      "That sounds romantic. Was it your anniversary or something special?\n",
      "Yea i would do the same, safety first\n",
      "Yes. Now I see that it was better for us to be apart.\n",
      "That does sound kind of scary.\n",
      "That is annoying.\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that, at least he didn't suffer too long. My dog passed away suddenly last year so I know that feeling of not having a warning. \n",
      "At least everything turned out okay, distance can be scary when family lives far away.\n",
      "Yes you should, they should have to pay for your inconvenience and any damages to your belongings.\n",
      "Oh man, that would have been a nightmare! At least you were prepared though, kudos to you for thinking ahead!\n",
      "Nice that it cleared up.   Beach trips are always hit or miss with the weather.\n",
      "At least you are almost done then!\n",
      "I get scared when im high up\n",
      "True. At least you can get some work done without interruptions.\n",
      "I'm so sorry for your loss. I know that feeling, my dog died a few years ago and I was devastated.\n",
      "I'm glad you did have a good time! Cruises are so much fun. I've only been on one but would love to go on another.\n",
      "Thats amazing to hear that she overcame what they said\n",
      "yeah that would have been nice.  maybe tomorrow will be better!\n",
      "I bet it was really scary!\n",
      "Yes it is getting more and more expensive every year.\n",
      "That is so sweet of her. What was the occasion?\n",
      "I know! Try to resist next time! You got this!\n",
      "I have had them happen when I am asleep and wake up having a panic attack.  They are not fun at all.  I hope you find a way to prevent them from happening.\n",
      "Maybe put some food out with his favorite food in it and he will come running back to the house.\n",
      "Yeah, that would be really hard to deal with.  I hope you've moved on since then.\n",
      "did he ever find out \n",
      "Exactly.  Kindness is contagious.\n",
      "That is really impressive of him, education is so important no matter what age you are.\n",
      "Ewww! That's disgusting. I would have sent it back and demanded a new one.\n",
      "Aw that is embarrassing. At least it was not in front of anyone important.\n",
      "I would have been terrified! Did you find out why the door was open?\n",
      "I would be so mad if my sleep was being disturbed by that. Maybe talk to your neighbors about it?\n",
      "Pizza is the best food ever.\n",
      "That is so important to save for retirement, you will be so happy you did when you are older. \n",
      "That is a lot of responsibility but I am sure you will do great, just be patient with yourself and the kids will love you!\n",
      "Atleast there is that, but losing a pet is still tough.\n",
      "That's frustrating. I hate when my bills get delayed because of something like that.\n",
      "that is a good career to have. she must be really good at her job.\n",
      "Haha maybe you should get a small percentage then. You helped her achieve this.\n",
      "At least you had some entertainment.\n",
      "yes it is. he is becoming his own person now\n",
      "I would stay up past my bedtime too playing mine.\n",
      "well thats great news you are so close to getting that b average! keep studying hard and you got this!\n",
      "Oh okay, I'm sorry you had to give up your dog.\n",
      "Got to balance video games and cooking/cleaning haha\n",
      "i hate when that happens\n",
      "Oh really, I didn't know that. Why do they need to be that age?\n",
      "Ha ha, living on peanuts is better than no nuts at all. I'm happy that you are able to make it work.\n",
      "That is a great feeling to have. Cherish it.\n",
      "Nice, she must have known you wanted that pretty bad!\n",
      "thats good you didnt have to go to the doctor and yeah coughing up mucus is the worst\n",
      "Haha, maybe she did and is blaming you for it.\n",
      "Just take it one day at a time. Dont stress too much about it.\n",
      "Well that's good that it didn't claw you up! I wouldn't pet an outside cat, they could have diseases!\n",
      "Oh wow, that's a lot of pressure, but if you studied hard you should do great, just don't let the nerves get to you too much\n",
      "Haha, I bet! I would have too!\n",
      "yes i know how that goes, its hard to let go but you have to move on\n",
      "That is good it was nothing to worry about then.\n",
      "what happened? \n",
      "No just came really close to hitting you.\n",
      "yeah i would be mad too if my dog did that! maybe train him/her not to do that again lol\n",
      "I would be scared too. Did you try to kill it?\n",
      "You should be, school is hard work.\n",
      "that is really cool she has a talent\n",
      "That is so great to have a friend like that! I am so happy for you!\n",
      "That's good that she gave you a second chance.\n",
      "That is good to hear that it is caught early. You will beat it! Stay positive.\n",
      "I would have been too scared to do anything. I hope nothing like that happens again.\n",
      "Yeah probably haha, I would be too scared to try!\n",
      "thats good atleast its not worse than it was before \n",
      "At least he lived a long life and you got to have good memories with him.\n",
      "Yes you can have kids.  Just don't donate blood or semen.  Live a healthy life and you'll be fine.  I know a guy who has been positive for 20 years and is fine.  Just take care of yourself.  Lots of love and support.\n",
      "I've played that a few times.  It's a lot of fun.\n",
      "Too nervous maybe?\n",
      "Oh wow, I had no idea you were working on finding a cure for diabetes. I'm sorry your coworker beat you to it. Maybe you'll find something else to discover then!\n",
      "Yeah I felt bad about it for awhile but now I just laugh about it lol\n",
      "I have not seen that one yet but have heard good things about it\n",
      "I have a brother like that too. Frustrating.\n",
      "Yes, they are trying to silence certain voices before the election\n",
      "Probably because they were hiding too\n",
      "I would be furious! Maybe she can explain why she did it?\n",
      "That is very nice of you! did he make it to canada?\n",
      "Haha!  Even above average is pretty darn good!  I bet he's still a smart kiddo though!\n",
      "Haha, that's pretty funny. I bet your dog is pretty smart. I wish my dog could talk.\n",
      "I'm ready for the challenge, bring it on. We'll see who the true champion is.\n",
      "Its okay, we all have those moments. Hopefully she forgave you.\n",
      "That is good. Flu can last a while so it is good you are feeling better.\n",
      "Wow that is a story. I am sorry you had to go through that. Atleast you have the memories.\n",
      "Did you make her clean it up?!?! That would be hilarious if you did!\n",
      "Oh I see, you were catching up on some \"me time\"? That's important to do every once in a while.\n",
      "I would blow it all on cocaine too. Kid better invest that prize money wisely or he will be blowing it all on hookers and blow in no time.\n",
      "Yeah, I wouldn't bring it up then, maybe keep an eye out for other opportunities.\n",
      "Pets are family. Losing them is hard.\n",
      "Atleast you can start over fresh and find someone better for you.\n",
      "Yum, I love apple pie with ice cream!\n",
      "People are always so busy with their technology to notice the world around them\n",
      "Haha, I agree, owning a pair of those would make me happy.\n",
      "There is something very comforting about a fire while camping. I bet you slept well that night.\n",
      "No it isn't fair to anyone to put them on a pedestal and expect them to be perfect all the time\n",
      "Wow, I wouldn't have thought of doing that. Did you have a flashlight or anything?\n",
      "I see what you mean, but I think Dubai is pretty modern.\n",
      "That is good that it was still there! Phew.\n",
      "thats a lot of money, maybe you should start an emergency fund for unexpected problems like that\n",
      "Xbox helped you a lot? I don't have one so I don't know how it helps haha.\n",
      "thats great that you are feeling good today \n",
      "right! and if the worst happens at least you have a desk to sit at while the world ends lol!\n",
      "Just go in confident and you'll do great. Good luck!\n",
      "I know! For me it's cleaning the bathroom. When it's clean, I feel like the world is a better place lol\n",
      "That's a great way to look at it! Fear won't stop you from achieving your goals!\n",
      "You raised her right. Kids learn from their parents.\n",
      "Oh man, that would drive me crazy. I'm lucky my neighbors aren't too bad. They're loud sometimes, but they don't keep me up. I hope your new neighbors are nice and quiet!\n",
      "That is so great! I bet they are having the time of their lives!\n",
      "Exactly! Sometimes I just want to go back to being a kid again!\n",
      "Maybe try social media?\n",
      "That was very nice of him!  I would have tipped him good!\n",
      "Maybe one day she will move back close to you\n",
      "Yes it does, what kind of wine do you like to drink?\n",
      "I get that. I miss my home state sometimes.\n",
      "Awwwww they are so cute! What is his name?\n",
      "That still sounds kind of scary though, being blindfolded and not knowing what was going on.\n",
      "That is really nice of you. More people should do that.\n",
      "That is a good idea.  You never know when you might need it.\n",
      "That's good to hear, sometimes you just have to find ways to make yourself happy even if it's a little weird.\n",
      "Its hard not to be mad when they destroy your things, but cats are cute so its hard to stay mad at them for long.\n",
      "Oh, that's too bad you didn't win, but at least you got to perform, right? Did you sing, dance, or do something else?\n",
      "I would be too, but sometimes the cheapest things are the best.\n",
      "Especially when there is nothing you can do to help them feel better. All you can do is be there for them and try to make them comfortable\n",
      "That's good that you talk to them about it. Kids need to understand emotions.\n",
      "how long will you stay?\n",
      "Exactly, age shouldn't be a factor in getting an education.\n",
      "Are you excited?\n",
      "I bet he causes a lot of mischief. I love animals with personalities.\n",
      "she is very organized\n",
      "What kind of shooting game? Like call of duty?\n",
      "Wow.  That's a long time.  I bet you've seen some incredible things while sky diving.\n",
      "yea keep it up\n",
      "I can see how that would be annoying. Is there another way for them to turn around?\n",
      "Oh cool! What is the comic book of?\n",
      "I would have been scared too. I don't like dogs that bark a lot.\n",
      "I can imagine it would be hard at first but I am sure it would be worth it in the end.\n",
      "They are, and they keep getting smaller and smaller.\n",
      "You will pay for that cake tomorrow when you are full of sugar.\n",
      "Well as long as you can help your family when they need it, that is all that really matters.  I am sure they appreciate it.\n",
      "I haven't seen that one yet, is it any good?\n",
      "Yes i love our organic store here. Its expensive but worth it for the good food \n",
      "I guess I never really think about it when I'm washing dishes. I just focus on getting them clean.\n",
      "But they still refuse to use it! Ha ha my kids are the same.\n",
      "They don't think about anyone else but themselves.\n",
      "Yes they can be.  I hate people who shoot animals for fun.\n",
      "Maybe you should try going for lunch instead of dinner? That way it won't be as expensive.\n",
      "That is so nice that they have brought their culture to your town.  I would shop there all the time!\n",
      "Oh wow!  I hope you win for sure then!\n",
      "Ugh management need to do something!\n",
      "Yes, I am sure she will, she still looks great too!\n",
      "Yes I do, but I am saving up money to move out.\n",
      "That is very sweet of you. Did it help cheer him up?\n",
      "I would have ran inside and locked myself in the house for hours.\n",
      "I get too anxious driving long distances. I have to listen to podcasts to keep my mind off of it.\n",
      "Nice.  I am jealous.  I need a new computer.\n",
      "I hate going to the store in general so I shop online for everything I can\n",
      "Oh I see. I don't really like sad endings in movies.\n",
      "kids are so smart when they are little, they absorb everything!\n",
      "Ouch! Did you go to the doctor?\n",
      "well atleast he woke you up, could have been worse pranks he could have played\n",
      "I would have been so scared!  I hate skunks!\n",
      "I've only been to Italy myself, but would love to visit the other places you mentioned!\n",
      "Haha! Kids are sneaky! Mine would have left toys everywhere!\n",
      "yeah i remember hiking up to the zipline was the worst part, but the view was worth it, and the lines went by pretty fast where i went\n",
      "Accidents happen man no big deal just glad its not a sprained finger or worse a broken one\n",
      "Mine passed away last year. It was hard to see her suffer.\n",
      "Did you have to get radiation too?\n",
      "thats a long move but i am sure they will be happier there, what city in cali are you moving to?\n",
      "let them get AIDS or something, serve them right for trashing up the streets\n",
      "I would move if I were you for safety reasons\n",
      "Yeah, it's pretty crazy to think about how big everything is!\n",
      "That is really nice of them to come and visit you then\n",
      "Oh no! Did you exchange them?\n",
      "i hope it works for you\n",
      "Just take a deep breath and speak slowly and clearly.\n",
      "That's good! Did you go back and get it?\n",
      "That is awesome. I bet you can remember a lot of things just by hearing them once.\n",
      "Haha I wouldn't blame you! They are pretty crazy to look at.\n",
      "That is horrible, did you at least get your items back?\n",
      "i bet it did. i hope he is ok now.\n",
      "I bet he must have been huge! I can barely lift the bar let alone plates on it.\n",
      "They love being around people, especially when there's not many of them around!\n",
      "Oh my god! Did you kill it?\n",
      "Yeah you should keep the cat out of the laundry room then.\n",
      "Yes it does. I lost my cat to cancer as well.  She was my favorite. \n",
      "Oh yeah I used to listen to that when I was younger. Still do sometimes. My favorite was My Chemical Romance.\n",
      "Well atleast it wasn't a coyote or something trying to eat your dog.\n",
      "Poor thing, hopefully it makes a full recovery.\n",
      "sounds delicious i hope you both enjoy it\n",
      "That is a great reward for your hard work. Where do you plan on going?\n",
      "Maybe you should ask them to leave you alone while you work?\n",
      "you can always invite friends over to do things with\n",
      "I hope it's not that.\n",
      "I bet it will be a lot of fun with your family! what cruise line are you going with?\n",
      "yeah cook him his favorite meal he will love it\n",
      "yeah i stock up too just in case the power goes out for a few days\n",
      "Oh wow that is annoying, did he have to stay all night?\n",
      "pepper is a must have on mac and cheese for me\n",
      "Necklaces can definitely get you noticed. What color is the shirt?\n",
      "Dogs can get jealous and do that. Hopefully a vet visit solves the problem.\n",
      "Yes true, sometimes seniority gets in the way of promotions. Glad you were able to overcome that.\n",
      "i bet they will be excited\n",
      "Pets always make things better dont they\n",
      "Yes great memories to cherish!\n",
      "Yes lucky to have such a man. When is the wedding\n",
      "yes i would keep it safe\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he keeps his job.\n",
      "How long did you have him for\n",
      "Thats great. She must be very proud.\n",
      "Were you a passenger or driver?\n",
      "I would have swatted it away hard\n",
      "Poor dog. She will probably do it again. Mine does weird things like that.\n",
      "I hope you feel confident when you give it!\n",
      "Maybe you should set a reminder on your phone to feed her the jelly.\n",
      "They can be very cruel sometimes.  I am glad you were not bullied too much about it.\n",
      "Oh no, I hate when pizza doesn't taste good.\n",
      "I bet that was really stressful! At least you made it there in the end though\n",
      "Haha, I bet that was embarrassing! I always forget to take my cap off before races too lol\n",
      "Oh wow that's a tough job. He must work long hours.\n",
      "Oh, well then I guess that was just a one time thing?\n",
      "maybe contact lenses would help?\n",
      "Being with the ones you love is always nice\n",
      "Did he get caught?\n",
      "Well, at least your dog did not get sick. Maybe next time put the food away.\n",
      "And did he obey?  Or did he act like he didn't hear you?\n",
      "You should try to train her not to do that!\n",
      "Well at least it's not ruined then. They usually have protectors on library books to prevent that.\n",
      "Of course, we all have to go through tough times.\n"
