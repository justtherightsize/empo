"~Well, you know she'll get over it, but it does hurt.~She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl~sentimental~I understand how frustrating it can be when your child is upset with you. It's important to remember that children can be very focused and independent, especially at that age. It's possible that your daughter feels like she doesn't need you because she's used to being able to do things on her own. However, it's also important for children to have the support and guidance of their parents. I suggest trying to talk to your daughter and understand her perspective. Maybe she feels like you're being too critical or that you don't trust her. It's possible that she just needs some space and time to process her emotions. Whatever the case may be, it's important to show empathy and understanding towards her. Let her know that you're there for her and that you care about her.~0~0~1~0~0~0~0.0~0.0~1.0

It's tough to hear your child cry, but remember that it's a normal part of the sleep training process. Here are a few tips that might help:

1. Stay calm and reassuring. Your child can sense your emotions, so try to stay calm and reassuring. Let them know that you're there for them and that everything will be okay.

2. Use a soothing voice. Speak to your child in a soft, soothing voice. This can help them feel more comfortable and calm.

3. Offer comfort. If your child is crying, offer them comfort. You can hold them, rock them, or sing to them. This can help them feel more secure and less scared.

4. Be patient. Sleep training can take time, so be patient. It's okay if your child doesn't sleep through the night right away. Keep trying and be consistent."~0~0~2~2~0~0~4.0~0.0~4.0

But, you can try some techniques to manage your fear of spiders. You can start by educating yourself about spiders and learning about their behavior. You can also try exposure therapy, where you gradually expose yourself to spiders in a controlled environment. Additionally, you can try relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation to help you manage your fear. Remember, it's a process and it may take time, but with patience and persistence, you can overcome your fear of spiders.~0~0~0~0~0~0~0.0~0.0~0.0

But, it was hard to see it at that time lol~jealous~I understand how you felt at the time. It's natural to feel jealous or insecure when someone you care about is being helpful to someone else. But, it's also important to remember that your husband was trying to do the right thing. It's possible that he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, and he didn't have any bad intentions. I hope you can forgive him for what you thought was his behavior.~0~0~1~0~0~0~0.0~0.0~1.0

When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids.
