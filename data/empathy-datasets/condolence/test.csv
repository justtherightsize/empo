965,3.0,"I realize I only gave the bare bones of the story, but largely he's been saying that as a way to keep me from leaving. He changed so much after his affair (5 years ago), after he called me worthless when our daughter passed if SIDS (12 years ago), and after my grandmother passed and all he could say was 'she's been dying for 8 years, I need you to support me because my base in Rust got raided by my friends'.

That last one happened in Feb of this year. Every little thing like that added up, it was my fault he had an affair, it was my fault our daughter died, I wasn't supportive enough when his base got raided as the woman who raised me was being put to rest. I wish I could say he had truly changed, but even the last week has told me no. I'm still not supportive, I'm still worthless because he's not working, and he's still going to kill himself if I don't come back.

Sorry this turned in to a textbook. I'm doing everything I can to ignore him, and sometimes the feels and words overflow. Also, as tone doesn't come through text, I don't believe what he is telling me about being worthless, and I'm getting help to work through it :)","Wow...just wow.

Nope, there's no making him happy. He needs professional help, but that's not your responsibility, of course.

It sounds like you're on a good path. Keep going and never give up! And don't apologize for telling your story, EVER.

17,1.0,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched. I don't want people to think I'm not grateful, but 4 gildings is plenty! Please consider donating to your local Men's shelter instead.

Thankfully I was lucky enough to reconnect with him and we have a really good relationship now compared to before but he still doesn't really allow emotions to be apparent.   

I had surgery in July and I asked him to pick me up when I was released since I couldn't drive...

Outside school, speaking from experience? The best thing you can do is look relentlessly for an opportunity to work, or travel... well, *anywhere*. Having a job gets you out of the house and pushes you to do something (as a chronic procrastinator and general lacker of motivation myself, it is a blessing to work and I'm going insane in unemployment).

That's my two cents worth of advice ;)

It’s been used as a way to make me look stupid so many times. I know that I need to rebuild healthy brain patterns with healthy people. But how do I even know who to trust to start working on that?

If you believe them when they tell you that they are with you because of your personality, then you’re dumber than I thought.” I tried not to believe him. But he wasn’t 100% wrong.

Once you really work on yourself and get healthy, you will attract the right guys. Put yourself in situations to meet good guys (not in bars, parties, etc). I met my husband at church.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He went from perfectly happy and healthy, to multiple grand mal seizures on a nightly basis. I ended up spending on every test that was offered at the clinic out of desperation, and they still couldn't find anything. All of his tests were coming back indicating that he was perfectly healthy. Suddenly the seizures had stopped, and he seemed to be getting better. So I made the most of it, and I made sure he was even more spoiled than before.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That lasted about a month before his health declined even faster. He went from running with me every night, getting special treats, and nightly snuggles, to seizures nearly every hour. It was a horrific experience. I tried a seizure medication prescribed by the vet, but I noticed that he just wasn't there mentally. He was on auto pilot, and I'd see it in his eyes every time a seizure would occur. I remember the way he'd stumble and sway, then he'd freeze with a blank stare, and then he'd go back to just existing. 


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He didn't acknowledge me like he used to, and it just didn't feel right. This went on for two weeks, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to watch. The medication wasn't helping, so I finally ended up making an appointment to have him euthanized, because I didn't have the heart to watch his health decline even further.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I took time off of work, and I made sure he had a big splurge day before taking him in.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The day of his appointment he was so weak that I had to carry him into the vets office, and all I could do was stand there and hold him. Frozen by the thought that I'd be leaving without my best friend, so I forced myself to walk up to the counter. As tears welled up in my eyes, I did my best to announce to the lady at the reception desk that I had an appointment scheduled. The lady told me to have a seat, so I found a quiet corner and held him as close as I could.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I remember the seeming long walk down the eerily silent hall towards our room, then the sound of the door latching behind us. The guy asked me some questions about my dog, and asked if I wanted time alone with him. I did... but right as he asked that, another seizure hit, then another, followed by another one, and I lost my composure.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The guy assured me that it would be quick and painless, and to let me know when I was ready. So I apologized to my dog, and said my goodbyes and loved on him one last time before we followed through with it.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He had finally passed. That last breath was so painful that I can still feel it today.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The guy told me to take my time and said that I could spend as much time as I needed. So I laid on the ground holding my dog while sobbing quietly for what seemed like hours. I left the clinic and wandered around aimlessly for the rest of the day. I had no idea what I was doing, and I didn't have anyone else for support.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It took months to even begin to function like a normal person again. I ended up packing away a few of his favorite toys and blankets, then deep cleaned my entire house. It still hurts like hell, but I try to remember the good times.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I still deal with severe bouts of depression, and I still miss having him around, but I can't bring myself to add a new family member after that experience. In a way, it ruined me. Even to this day I feel guilty playing with other peoples dogs, then I remember how much I miss having mine around.

- my eating disorder relapsed in a big way. i just don't fucking know what to do because honestly? is it even a relapse if my idea of non disordered eating is still really fucking disordered? i've been dealing with my ed since i was eleven and i'm just exhausted and i'm tired of not being able to act like a normal human being around food. my friend's family literally knows me by how little i eat, i was at her house and she and her mom commented on how i never eat when i'm there and i'm just... exhausted by the prospect of spending my entire life like this. people like me better when i'm restricting. i know that's fucked up, but they really do, and i don't know how to move past that. and i really care about being vegetarian and eventually going vegan but i know an ed therapist would ask me if it's about having control over what i eat and i think it is. like i don't want to eat animals, i went veggie because of my dogs, but i also love having this special thing about me and i'm so fucked up about food i hate it i hate being alive in this body

- i found out when i have to retake my exams in the uk. i'm in the us right now and the first is in a week and six days. i don't want to think about what happens if i choke again. 

- i was informed of my schedule for next year (sans one course) and i'm so fucking depressed. i chose my uni three years ago for its human rights courses and what do they do? not offer any human rights courses. i'm so upset because i have to base my dissertation on the topics i take this year and i don't give a fuck about any of this. i've been in school what like 18 years now just waiting to get to the point where i get to take the subjects i want to take and i don't even get to because i have a learning disability and all 19 of my exams were essay based so i choke on them and don't have high marks at all. i wanted to go to law school because i studied in the hague and i wanted to write my dissertation on free speech and genocide and i'm just so hurt and sad and tired. nothing ever goes my way because i'm so fucked up.

- exactly a month ago i left an abusive situation in the worst way possible and i'm still processing what the abuse did to me but one of the abusers has wormed their way back into my life. or is trying to. and i brought it up with the person who has the power to remove them from our circle but they've ghosted me.

Sorry for being a downer","Hey man, I'm really sorry to read that. I don't know very much about the peripheral neuropathy (only knew one person with it and it was a little girl), but what you describe about your foot is more than enough to understand how you feel.

I know that what I will tell you probably won't be enough to cheer you up, and my english is still pretty basic so I can't write the message I'd really like to send you, but the main idea is: *Cherish your life anyway*. You won't be able to do that today, or tomorrow, maybe not even this month. But I sincerely hope you can recover from the emotional shock and realize that, as long as you are alive, this world is full of good things to be happy about and to enjoy the best we can. It might sound impossible now, and I know it is easier to write than to do, but don't let the bad things win over the good things of life. I really really hope that, sooner than later, you will listen to Babymetal or watch a concert and find yourself smiling and feeling happy again.

I am sorry for the lack of words or strange phrases, it is a bit hard to write this in english. However please count with me if you need someone to talk with, about anything you want, I don't care as long as I can help you :) so feel free to PM me anytime!

166,1.5,"My girlfriend is in a different country for a little over 30 days. I’d be lying if I said my anxiety remained at normal levels when she left. I don’t lean on her to lower my anxiety, but I’m most comfortable with her as we’ve known each other for 7 years and been together 3. So now that she’s gone I’m a fucking mess and trying to do things on my own, like going out to eat, or out for a drink just doesn’t go well. 

Meh. 

Overthinking is the worst part about anxiety imo","I’m sorry about it friend. At first I’m really glad that you have this amazing relationship that lasted a long time and this person have who you can be around and kinda feel better. I understand that it is very rough for having that person missing around you for an extended period of time. But I believe that you are not a mess like what you think you are. And I have faith in you that you can make your way out of this. It’s true that people and everyone around us can really bring us tremendous amount of stress. I get really anxious when I enter a new group of people and there was one time I almost gonna cry(I’m a 17 year old boy). So it’s quite  a pain in ass to deal with them sometimes. Also I’m lowkey a judgemental person so I kinda also assumed that other people are very judgmental so I’m really careful about what I do sometimes, which I really overoveroverthink about other people’s opinion about me (idk if u have this or nah) fearing that they don’t like me or think I’m weird or something. And that ducked me up, even gave me slight depression because I felt like a failure and nobody liked me those kinda shit. But I’m trying to say that it’s ok to care, even it’s a nice thing to care about other people and their opinions, but not to such a great degree. In fact, no offense but people really give way less fuck about you or anything you do then you think, and even when you do some slight weird stuff, it won’t really bother how you look in their eyes, because they’ve got their own stuff to handle. So you can try to slightly reduce your thought about other people’s opinion, and remember they don’t really care about what you do, so it’s ok to be yourself. You will not be judged. And starts small. Like you don’t have to go to all those crowded place in the beginning, but just your neighborhoods, like a Sunday morning walks where you can greet your neighbors (I hope they are very nice person). Despite these know that it’s a very rough process since tbh I overthinking came back to me about a week ago again (I’ve dealt with overthinking for about a year and I’m getting better), and it’s really gonna take a long time. It’s more like a marathon but not a sprint. but I believe you can make it. There is that light and hope at the end of the tunnel.

Also if you haven’t talked to your girlfriend, I hope you do so, since I believe she’ll be very supportive towards you and help you along the way. It’s good to have companions that will assist you so that you won’t be alone. Especially for someone who love and care about you very much, it’s gonna do a way better job.

I’m sorry if I digressed a bit or what I talked about isn’t what you meant, but I genuinely hope you will get better since overthinking is like a tumor that gives pain we cannot express.

Even we, who have faith in something bigger, can wipe out our feelings. And even if you are not a believer-man, you have to agree that we are emotional beings, apart from animals.

So, my first advice is: cry. Suffer. Get sick. Stay in the bed. Call some relatives and friends and tell them that you need to stay alone. Give yourself some time to assimilate what happened to you and your life.

When you least expect it, you'll be thinking about the future. And this is the right moment to get up, find some sport or hell, get back to shuffle if it makes you happy! At the end, there's only on person who may say what cheers you up or not!

We're christians and not think about divorce, but I have some friends and relatives that passed through this.

Even we, who have faith in something bigger, can wipe out our feelings. And even if you are not a believer-man, you have to agree that we are emotional beings, apart from animals.

So, my first advice is: cry. Suffer. Get sick. Stay in the bed. Call some relatives and friends and tell them that you need to stay alone. Give yourself some time to assimilate what happened to you and your life.

When you least expect it, you'll be thinking about the future. And this is the right moment to get up, find some sport or hell, get back to shuffle if it makes you happy! At the end, there's only on person who may say what cheers you up or not!

​

I cannot imagine what you're passing through, but to cage your sadness and pretend that it never existed isn't the best option.

Remember! If you are at the bottom of the pit, there's only one way to go! Up!

Cheers! And the shufflers will always be here. </listener>"
383,1.5,"Well. I just lost my job. Pretty bummed about the whole thing. I lost it due to performance issues (never happened to me before).

807,1.5,"This is long and I’m on my phone so I apologize for formatting errors. 


Mid-September she was injured while playing out back. I don’t know what happened. We have a boxer and German Shepherd as well, so I assume one of them ran her over or something. 


I took her to the vet that day and the vet took an X-ray but saw no fractures. She diagnosed a sprain and said to bring her back if it wasn’t better in a couple of weeks. It wasn’t, so I took her back. We saw a different vet who diagnosed it as a CCL tear. We scheduled the surgery for two weeks later.


 The day of the surgery, the first vet called and said she wasn’t having the surgery because the CCL tear was a misdiagnosis. She actually fractured her femur in the initial injury and it had turned into Perthes Disease, meaning the head and neck of the femur were necrotic. We scheduled a femoral head ostectomy for the next week.


 I think we were mid-November by this point. It never healed right. Her body was supposed to build a false joint over the end of the femur that was cut. Instead she ended up with a bone infection. At this point it’s around Christmas. 


We start antibiotics. She seems much better. Her leg isn’t grinding anymore and we’re pretty hopeful the false joint is finally starting to form. We start more physical therapy with laser treatments to move things along. Nothing really helped. She was still in a lot of pain and she hadn’t been using her leg for months. 

I finally had enough last week. I took her back in and, surprise, she has another infection. She just turned a year old at the end of January and she has been in pain since September. The vet and I talked and decided amputation was her best bet.

Mid-September she was injured while playing out back. I don’t know what happened. We have a boxer and German Shepherd as well, so I assume one of them ran her over or something. 


I took her to the vet that day and the vet took an X-ray but saw no fractures. She diagnosed a sprain and said to bring her back if it wasn’t better in a couple of weeks. It wasn’t, so I took her back. We saw a different vet who diagnosed it as a CCL tear. We scheduled the surgery for two weeks later.


 The day of the surgery, the first vet called and said she wasn’t having the surgery because the CCL tear was a misdiagnosis. She actually fractured her femur in the initial injury and it had turned into Perthes Disease, meaning the head and neck of the femur were necrotic. We scheduled a femoral head ostectomy for the next week.


 I think we were mid-November by this point. It never healed right. Her body was supposed to build a false joint over the end of the femur that was cut. Instead she ended up with a bone infection. At this point it’s around Christmas. 


We start antibiotics. She seems much better. Her leg isn’t grinding anymore and we’re pretty hopeful the false joint is finally starting to form. We start more physical therapy with laser treatments to move things along. Nothing really helped. She was still in a lot of pain and she hadn’t been using her leg for months. 

I finally had enough last week. I took her back in and, surprise, she has another infection. She just turned a year old at the end of January and she has been in pain since September. The vet and I talked and decided amputation was her best bet. The fact that she hasn’t been using her leg for months will help her recovery because she’s not having to learn something new and her remaining back leg has already built the muscle to compensate.

The depression makes me not want another child, but not giving my daughter a sibling because I can't deal with it makes me feel like a selfish and horrible mom. Its a wonderful catch-22. ;) </speaker> <listener> You're getting so much good advice here, but I thought I'd chime in, too.

Do not try for another baby right now. Not until you get yourself taken care of. You'll have plenty of time to have more babies *after* you take care of this anxiety. The level you're describing is definitely not normal.

I'm a chill mom. How I got this chill was making sure I took care of myself. I had PPA so bad after I went back to work that I had to be on meds.

139,1.0,"We just had a cat put down today. 

He had brain damage and was being highly aggressive, and was likely having ‘mild’ seizures. We took him to the vet a few months ago and we’re told he would get better for a while and then would get mean again but worse and it would just repeat like that again and again. Our only options in a small town were to try a medication that could make things worse or put him down. We elected to give him a chance. Maybe we would be different. The vet said to call her when we needed her. 

He would randomly bite us hard with no provocation or warning. He’d be cuddly and sweet and we would touch him and he’d bite hard and latch on, then go right back to snuggling. He refused to let our other older cat touch the food and regularly tore stuff up. His behavior also didn’t follow many patterns. He’d also cuddle and be sweet and actually want to be touched and loved. You couldn’t tell which it was. Sometimes he wanted to love the other cat and sometimes he just wanted to hurt her. 

Before the vet visit, we’d tried just about every single cat behavior method out there. Water spraying, rewarding good behavior, ignoring ad behavior, spanking, etc. I don’t think there’s one we didn’t try, and we were willing to try some out there stuff. Didn’t need to, because he started to improve. 

We thought our cat would be different. The vet would be wrong and he was just in a weird mood for the last year (first year we had him) and it would be okay. He got better for a few months. He was mostly a normal cat, with a few bad days here and there. We were still scared of him, because he would still randomly explode with little to no warning. 

He got bad again, just as the vet said. And worse than it was before. He stopped purring or showing any signs of affection or happiness. Instead of being mostly awful with some spots of sunshine, he was entirely awful. 

We didn’t want to put him down. We’ve cried about it for days and there were so many times my stepmom wanted to turn the car around. When you’re making a tough decision, it’s hard to remember that you’re doing what needs to be done and easy to remember all the times he was cuddly and sweet. It’s also easy to convince yourself that you can make it work and just separate the cats and wear gloves and drive him several states away to go to behavioral therapy and have surgeries and it will all be okay.

I’m thankful she didn’t turn around because we don’t have to be scared anymore, and I know he wasn’t happy. He wouldn’t have been happy if we tried all the expensive weird treatments and surgeries and neither would we. 

As much as it hurts, I’m glad that he’s gone and that we can still remember the good times. I’m glad we didn’t wait until years from now and grow to hate him. At least we can still focus on the good times that we had and be nostalgic about him. And I’m glad that he’s not in pain. 

I miss him. Well, the good him. The him that we had on the good days that was snuggly and goofy and soft. I miss snuggling with him on the couch and baby talking him and giving him weird nicknames. 

I don’t miss the bites and scratches and screams and fear. I also don’t miss our other cat being scared and hungry. I don’t miss my little sister being covered in bandaids because he bites her in her sleep. I don’t miss the frustration that comes with knowing there’s nothing you can do other than tolerate the situation or admit you were wrong and euthanize a visibly healthy cat. 

I wish that we lived in an area where we could have had access to something that could have helped him. I wish he didn’t have brain damage. I wish we could have done something to help him and not have to euthanize him. I wish that I wasn’t three hours away when it happened. I wish I could have said goodbye one last time and been there. Most of all, I just wish things could have been okay and the vet was wrong and we could have had our cat.

* take solo trips and do anything that you wish on those trips!
* have a great conversation starter for a first date ;)

It feels like sheer luck at this point. </speaker> <listener> As someone who just had this happen to them a few days ago, I’m so, so sorry. Mine only lasted about two weeks as well. I cannot imagine what you’re going through right now, being at this date again. It’s already exhausting heart wrenching enough all on its own. Be easy on yourself. I already told my husband that if we get back to this time next year with no success I’m probably going to be a wreck. I’m sending you all the positive vibes and hoping for the best for you 🤞🏼 *hugs* 💕 </listener>"

97,2.0,"Thank you for your response and your comment about my needs. Honestly it's been so hard and I feel like my self confidence is down and even depressed at times due to constant feeling of guilt that I'm somehow not enough and causing him pain and depression. He is an amazing dad in terms of being there for the kids. 
If you don't mind, can you point out which traits sound like BP and what difference you see when your SO is on his meds? I'm hopeful and would like to find out what the medication could help with. I'm pretty sure he won't see a doctor and refuse treatment. I haven't been successful in getting him to see a phychiatrist and he already wants to leave so I'm hesitant to bring up this subject atm.","I felt exactly the way you do now. 


 I'm just some stranger on the internet, but I strongly suggest you start focusing on yourself. You didn't cause his depression/BP and you aren't responsible for it. Stop feeling guilty. Easier said than done, I know, but try.

You can't control what he does. It sounds like he's not interested in any sort of treatment, and you can't change that unilaterally. So what CAN you do? Take care of yourself. Go to therapy. Make sure your needs and your children's needs are being met and stop worry about his needs. He's an adult and he needs to figure out how to manage himself. He wants to leave? Let him. What are you getting out of the relationship at this point? He doesn't support you in any way that I can see. He's not your friend, he doesn't contribute to your finances, and he doesn't even help around the house. It sounds like he's a good father, which is fantastic. But he can be a good father after he leaves too. 

It's possible that he'll leave, figure some stuff out, and ask to come back. We hear about that sort of thing a lot on this sub. I suggest that if that happens, you make his return conditional on his seeking treatment and complying with his doctors. In the meantime, work on making yourself feel happy and pursue your own life. 

As far as what treatment can help with, it is different for everyone. In the case of my husband, he's taking 3 different medications and going to therapy weekly. He also adheres to a strict daily schedule that means he has to do things like shower, eat, exercise, chores, at regular, set times. His pdoc strongly suggested this and it has been great. If you think about BP disorder in terms of a wave pattern with peaks and valleys, treatment lowers the peaks and raises the valleys. He still has highs and lows, but there is a ceiling and a bottom. His depressive episodes are now just sleeping more and maybe a few tears. His highs just mean he gets more chores done and he's a bit goofier. No more weeks in bed sobbing and suicidal thoughts. He never had highs to quite the extent you describe, which makes me wonder if your SO might be BP1, but that's for a pdoc to decide. 

Another note on treatment: it takes time, effort, and a great support team to be effective. It can take months to find the right treatment plan. It can also take months to find a great pdoc that you like, trust, and can afford. In my SO's case, it took a total of 2 years for him to really stabilize and he's been stable for about a year and a half now. And he WANTED treatment! So I think you're up against a lot.

Come up with a plan for yourself and your children that you can execute regardless of what he chooses to do with his life. Can you figure out how to support them and yourself without him around? It kind of sounds like you're already doing that. Maybe if he leaves you can continue to do that but perhaps you'll be able to let go of some of the justifiable resentment you are feeling at the moment.

707,1.0,"Thank you. You definitely get it. It's not just that our beloved, phenomenal family pet will one day (if I'm being honest, within the next year or two, but with his health it could happen much sooner--he's a dachshund so he's got his fair share of health issues, including a potentially serious one that recently cropped up) pass away and that we'll have to suffer that loss--what everyone in my family can feel is that this will cement this period of utter change and transition in our lives, and the loss of not only a member of our family, but the life we have lived up until this point. My older brother has long since moved away, my twin brother just moved overseas for work last week (for 15-months at least), and I'm in my last semester of grad school and will have to move for my career by the end of the summer. My parents are considering selling their home because it's a bit big and empty for just the two of them as well, and I can tell that the weight of their children finally setting out ""permanently"", along with the age and worsening health of our dog is weighing on them--it all weighs on me too.

In a sense, the vestiges of our family's life during me and my brothers' youths is ending, and the death of our beloved childhood pet and family cornerstone will make that end permanent. While he's still alive, there's always that sensation that none of the other changes are fully ""permanent"" ones. But once he goes, there will always be that before and after. Not to mention that our little guy played such an important role in providing my parents with companionship and purpose--an outlet for their affection--when me and my brothers were away at university. I worry about my father in particular, who is very deeply attached to him. 

I know that change always comes with new things to look forward to in the future, and I have plenty to be excited about, but this is definitely a very bittersweet time right now.

Ah shit, you mention rammstein and I immediately start headbanging. Ghost is very inspired by them in their life presence and with events like the forum and other stadium shows to come, Tobias and the nameless ghoils would fist bump you and your mother for your taste in good music.  

A message for your mother: I have never met you face to face but I see who you've raised to keep your memory alive. You should be proud to have raised an adult as awesome as you are.  We're requesting that you listen to ghost more and reap the rewards of sharing rammstein so many years ago.  We love you invisible ghoul.

Thank you for sharing,  I know that wasn't easy to share </listener>"

I was talking to my dad the other day and he mentioned that my sister might not be able to make it.

Some context as to why this is so upsetting: My fiancé and I live in the PNW, my family is in the South. They haven't bothered to visit us at all in the 2+ years we've lived here (though they also didn't bother to visit when we were only a 5hr drive away either). Albeit, we both work in entertainment, so time can be short, but we've learned how to balance it a little better so we can still be kickass hosts (shoutout to FMIL who did visit for Thanksgiving this year and had a great time). Meanwhile, we have visited them a couple of times over the years. It took a minute to decide where we wanted to get married, but we've settled on somewhere closer to where we live, to make planning easier on us, and to not isolate the community we've built around us. and we're in a decently popular summer destination, and fuck it my family can come our way for once so it might as well be for our wedding.

My dad has cautioned against a PNW wedding because some of my family might not be able to make it. That's fine. They're super conservative, future family in law tends to lean more left (and we're trying desperately to avoid the next election year for this reason). Most of the family I thought he was referring to was his side that we only see for weddings and funerals. I like them and would prefer they be there but if they can't make it, it's still fine, because we're not made of money. To ""compromise"", my dad suggested we have multiple receptions across the country (read: he doesn't want to travel).

My sister on the other hand has made a series of life choices that have led to her, her fiancé, and my niece all living with my dad. From what Dad's said, they are unemployed or underemployed. I'm not impressed with what I hear of FBIL- only spends about 10min/day with my niece, while dropping hours in my former bedroom/his current mancave playing video games, was fired from a post office, it goes on. I love my sister, but she tends to have her head in the clouds: she also got at the post office and turned it down because she only tried to arrange childcare after she got the job by asking the wisdom of fb who could and would watch the niece.


Dad initially told me that niece might not be able to make it. Well that sucks b/c ideally she'd be the flower girl, but it's still fine because I'd still have my family there. But when he mentioned my sister specifically, that hurt.

If we clear away the emotional reaction, let's look at facts: your sis is apparently in love with a man child.

Also, it might be really difficult for her to accept that you picked up stakes and are successful, far away, on your own.

Trying to find someone to fill that role of 5 years of companionship is impossible unless you've spent 5 years with them. It's tough!

- [""I choose to rise...""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/85hn48/i_choose_to_rise_not_fall_i_choose_to_live_not)

I hope this tumultuous time balances itself out for you soon. You aren't alone friend 💚💜💖 We will get through this together. We are so much stronger than we give ourselves credit for. It's there, it's just dragging its feet to emerge at the moment ;) 

I'm sending love, healing, and intentions of safety, protection from negative energies, clarity, and perseverance - your way. We got this. Just gotta weather a little bit more bullshit. We're so close though. I can feel the Light peeking back in :) </listener>"

877,2.0,"a little over a year ago my best friend shot herself. it feels like i could’ve done anything to help her. i didn’t know she was even depressed or suicidal because she acted super happy all the time. but around 15 minutes before she did it i was facetiming her. again, i didnt know she was suicidal, and i said something  banter-ish with the word “fuck” in it. it was just casual banter, something we both did often, but looking back on it she probably didnt feel that way. I don’t know the main reason she did it, and that’s what really bugs me.
I learned to cope with it pretty well, but it’s really starting to hit me now. I don’t know why.","The fact that she FaceTimed you 15 minutes before her death means you meant a great deal to her.

And now she’s achieved it, you can rejoice! Death by suicide is not some terrible thing. Our culture has made it such a unforgivable Sin!

548,1.5,"This might be stupid (but hey, stupid questions thread) but how do women in Japan deal with miscarriage? Do they take time off work to heal?

I had surgery on Saturday and forced myself to go to work on Monday and Tuesday, and by Tuesday evening I was in immense physical and emotional pain. I’m going to the doctor today, which my office knows (although they don’t know what for) but I don’t know if I’m ready to go back for the rest of the week.

Last month I had to take a week of bedrest and when I came back, the men were sympathetic and concerned about me but the women acted like I had the plague. When I told a coworker yesterday that I wasn’t sure if I would come in on Thursday, she proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day (like walk out of the room if only the two of us would be in it). 

I know I’m probably being 迷惑 but it’s not like they have to do extra work because I’m not there - they can’t do my job and I said I can work from home. And I tried to go in but I’m just not ready right now. I feel like quitting is almost easier than dealing with the social repercussions of not going in.","I am very sorry for your loss.

Yes you'd take at least a few days off, but it looks bad on you if you come to work one day and take a few days off later. It's better to take an entire week off. But to do so you might have to announce the reason and may need a doctor's note. I think the best thing to do at this point is to take the rest of the week and the next week as well. If you haven't seen the doctor yet, I recommend asking them if they can give you a note for it.

My dad has been in hospital for 90% of the year with all number of conditions and when he gets pushed out the door before he's ready, something else happens and he goes straight back in. Throughout this year he's had problems with his feet, kidneys, breathing, diabetes, hip on top of his other conditions.

Now, the doctors at the hospital think the best course of action is to put him in a home or facility otherwise he'd need 24/7 help from 2 people.
