423,6vdc5g,dlzesc7,Laziness or lack of motivation.. How have some of you battled depression related laziness?,"Hi Talk2muchaa, Lik onus111 suggested, 'feeling like doing something' just does not happen. If you're deeply unhappy with a lack of activity in your life, you just need to force yourself to do it - That's the sad reality of it. HOWEVER, that doesn't mean that there aren't ways to make FORCING yourself 'easier' on your mind and less stressful. If you want to build a house consisting of a 1000 bricks, take 30 seconds a day to lay 3 bricks and in one year, you will have a house. You can't punish yourself for not building Rome in a day. You will go on Twitch and see streamers who are making millions... YouTubers who are making millions. I mean fuck, PewDiePie has 56 million subscribers. But that shit didn't happen in just one day. You need to break shit up into increments. Perhaps others don't have to do this. But it's the only way I've found to get anything done. If you want to learn a language, go on Duolingo. Set a '10 points per day' challenge. Yes, it's jack-shit in terms of work. It takes literally 2 minutes a day, BUT- it's something. Try and ignore your brain saying Increase the goal to 50 a day, we're getting fuck-all done because this will break your discipline and you'll go back to 0 a day. Consistently doing 10 a day for 11 days, is better than doing 50 a day for 2 days, burning out and stopping altogether. The key to beating depression-induced laziness is TINY, incremental steps. For example, I'm learning Calculus on Khan Academy. One. Lesson. A Day. That's right- the average Khan video is around 10 minutes. I do one video a day. I am slowly, but consistently learning. Each day I go over the notes from the previous day. The problem isn't volume- it's consistency.",0,,0,,0,,"<speaker> Laziness or lack of motivation..

It has been documented but not yet diagnosed as doctors haven't figured out anything about it. The depression triggers the non epileptic seizures which cause major disturbances in my life. Crippling my quality of life and reducing what I can do. This feeds into my depression. More negative mental health the worse and more frequent the seizure like symptoms happen. Also have bad tremors and ticks in relation to the non epileptic seizures. I often fall down and have issues walking and standing. Can barely leave my home. Am reduces to limit movement inside my home which has caused weight gain from decrease movements which also stregnthens my depression which in return causes more seizure like episodes. No medication helps my mental or physical health. It actually worsens both. I am going without treatment because doctors refuse to take it seriously or are completely dumbfounded. It has been over a year since anything was prescribed to attempt to help me. Seen several specialist. This terrible cycle has lead me to multiple suicide attempts in the last few months. </target>

2973,9cleeq,e5bqhow,How do you feel. What is life with depression? Tell me your story,"To answer your question, I'm actually feeling alright today. Had an existential crisis last night and probably would have ended up killing myself or at the very least cutting myself if it wasn't for my dog licking my hand as I layed in bed crying myself to sleep (she's NEVER an affectionate dog, it took me a minute to even realise that she was actually licking my hand and I wasn't imagining shit). Thanks, Charlie. Anyways, for me depression is like absolute insanity. It's not just sadness or feeling like killing myself every other week. Just pure insanity. The best example I can give is probably two years ago, seventh grade. That was probably the lowest I had ever been. Every night when I went to sleep, I'd stay up on my phone. Not because I wanted to be, because it kept me from going to sleep and having the same nightmares I had every night. And then I'd look at the time, which by now was probably about 12 AM, realise how absolutely sad and pathetic I was and turn on some emo music, usually being something like Set it Off's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and listen to that as I (literally) sadistically laugh and cry myself to sleep. Some nights, that kind of stuff never happened. I'd have a peaceful sleep. Some nights I'd stay up all night debating whether I should text the suicide hotline, doing so, and it being no help whatsoever. So I'd get, maybe six hours of sleep at most. Before I'm woken up and have to get ready for school. How am I woken up? By my parents during the best part of my dream or the most peaceful part of my nightmare. Which already started my day off terribly. Then for an hour I'd be in the bathroom once again listening to emo music as I let the shower water run. My favourite songs to listen to were usually just about anything by Hollywood Undead. Not something a twelve year old should be listening to, sure. But it was a way to cope with my depression. As I listen to those songs, once again sadistically laughing at my own pain and often times end up cutting myself. I never cut myself deep, I was far to afraid of doing that. But... I enjoyed seeing the blood come out. I didn't cut for any sort of high or release of pain. It was sort of hard to explain. I was never addicted to cutting, I could stop or start whenever I wanted. Sometimes stopping for months at a time, but seeing the blood, made me feel happy. If you could have seen my eyes, especially when I cut myself, you wouldn't have seen any traces of a twelve year old. You'd see an insane person desperately trying to grasp on to the last straw of sanity, but nothing else. Some days I'd debate whether I should do a sort of murder-suicide thing. Or at the very least murder those who have caused me pain and suffering. Sometimes I'd have very and scarily elaborate plans on how I'd trick, kidnap, or kill my family. Things that you'd never expect from a twelve year old. But quite frankly, I might have physically been twelve, but my depression had probably aged and matured me way faster. The ride to school was probably the most traumatic for me. The ride was only about ten minutes (five minutes to school, five minutes in the carpool line). But those ten minutes were full of tests streaming down my face, me punching myself or ripping my hair out, or destroying my notebooks or pencils. Sometimes because I just really didn't want to go to school. Sometimes because my social anxiety got the best of me. Sometimes for reasons I don't even know. Me and my grandma would usually sit at the front of the school for about an hour or two, I'm sitting there trying to find a way to hurt myself because I'm angry, but don't want to let my anger out on her, and she's crying because she's absolutely lost on how to help me. I'd usually end up getting to school about a good three hours late. In school, I don't remember anything. Maybe it's because I was just walking around the school like a robot. Class for an hour, find your next class, repeat. In class, I'd have my head down in a book (not paying attention to the teacher whatsoever), I'd be mindlessly reciting the emo songs I listen to in my head, or I'd be talking to my friend AIDEN. (Yes, his name is in all caps). What I do definitely remember is hating all of my peers. Hell, I still hate them. It's not my hatred for them itself. It's just I can't stand how immature, idiotic, and stupid they were. Like who the hell goes around sticking Tide pods in their mouths for views on social media? Or who thinks it's funny to go around telling people to kill themselves because you heard your favourite edgy YouTuber say it and now you think it's hilarious to do so. Or why do you think it's cool and okay to curse every five seconds and use the N-word? Or why do you think that because you saw Kim Kardashian half naked in some photo shoot that you can show up to school with hardly any clothes on or sag and talk about fucking whores because your favourite rapper said it in their newest song? Act your own god damn age, quit trying to act like someone three times your age while being as immature as a kindergartener. More on AIDEN: AIDEN sort of just appeared out of nowhere. I don't know when or why I came up with him, I just sort of did. I'm not schizophrenic, he was 100% my own voice talking back to me in my head, but I enjoyed pretending to have someone to talk to. Someone who walked around with me everyday, knew exactly what I was thinking, and could relate to me all the time. Someone who (though was just my own voice), talked me out of suicide many times back in 7th grade. But slowly I started treating AIDEN a lot more like a real person. To the point where I could have easily been mistaken as someone with schizophrenia. At home I'd just go into my room and basically lock myself in. My door was never locked, my parents could come in and out as they pleased, but I would just hand out under the covers all day. I didn't want to see light, light didn't want to see me. I didn't bother with homework. I figured, I fail, I fail. I really had just given up with life at that point. The only reason why I hadn't killed myself was probably because I was too sad and lazy to bother trying. Occasionally I'd talk to AIDEN or watch YouTube or something, but most times I ended up listening to hypnosis. Hypnosis for me was like a way to escape real life. Like meditation, but instead of being left alone with my sad and depressing thoughts, I could listen to someone else. At first it was a nice little escape, but then it more or less because an addiction. An odd strange one that I'd never be able to explain to anyone, but an addiction none the less. I'd try to listen to hypnosis any time I could even if that meant going into my room away from family to listen to it. It kind of gave me the same high that cutting, smoking, drugs, or porn give other people. Even though it was just hypnosis, it really did become unhealthy. Before I knew it, it was time for me to go to bed. And then the whole cycle would repeat itself over and over and over and over and over again. It was the same routine, same schedule, same insanity over and over again. This sounds like more is going on than just depression, right? Like some other underlying mental illness. But this is all depression and a bit of social anxiety. No MPD, no schizophrenia, no bipolar disorder, I'm not a psychopath or sociopath. This was all thanks to my depression. No one actually knew how bad my mental state was. I never told anyone. I was diagnosed with depression and put on meds, but if anyone really knew how bad it was, I likely truly would have been put in a mental health hospital. This is where the most insane part was, since being on my meds, I'm a lot more stable. But I miss being the way I was. Even though they were supposed to, my meds didn't help my depression. It really just made me more stable. Now without AIDEN or cutting myself or the enjoyment of listening to emo music as I sadistically laugh and cry at the same time, I just feel empty. Though I was completely fucked up, it was still fun a times to laugh at how much I hate myself and my life. Now I can't do those things anymore. It's like being insane was a big part of me and my depression. The insanity itself was taken away, but the depression was still left.

1184,7jp5nt,dr83zli,I feel worthless. My gf cheated on me twice. I feel worthless. It has destroyed my self-esteem.,"Sorry to hear that. Obviously a very painful experience. Of course you're not crazy for feeling like that makes you wonder about your value as a person, but to get through this life you'll really want to get to the place where you understand other people's behaviors are a reflection of them and not of you. I'm not trying to suggest some stupid mind-trick here, of course when someone chooses another person over you, you are going to have thoughts of worthlessness and insecurity. But even if someone you are with realizes they'd rather be with someone else, it doesn't require them to cheat on you, they could just be an adult and end a relationship before doing something behind someone's back. Human love is fickle. There's no way to ever say that anyone who decides to spend time with you owes it to you to honor that choice forever, but it certainly doesn't mean they have to cheat and lie. This advice has stuck with me ever since I heard it on a podcast; don't ever expect other human beings to be rational, or to assume they are playing by the same set of rules and understandings as you are. They lived so much of their lives before you were ever it in, you have no idea if this behavior could be a reflection of something somebody else did to them in their past or whatever. You can't blame yourself for other people. Otherwise a total stranger could walk up to you on the street and punch you, and you'll spend the next week wondering what you did wrong instead of identifying that person as a violent crazy person. Regardless, it isn't exactly the most logical part of your mind that is going to feel rotten about this for a while, so no amount of information is going to make it feel better right away. But try to love yourself, and work on coming around to that understanding that other people's choices do not say anything about you, only about them.

In my experience sertraline was more intense than (es)citalopram the first few days and I started slow at like 12.5mg. It's really the first week - actually about the first 4 days - effect.

If it's too intense talk to your doctor about cutting back and moving up slower (I've settled on 50mg and that was after titrating up). Try splitting it up into at least two doses so it doesn't all hit you at once - sertraline's got a relatively short serum life and I'm preferring a morning and afternoon dose. ... and during this 'jittery' period try to take it at least 4 hours before bed so you'll have a shot at getting some proper sleep. It gets a *lot* more boring (but still potentially helpful) once your body adapts! Right now all sorts of stuff is going on with your serotonin and it's pretty much the 'psychedelic' part. Once your system adjusts the idea is that the drug is holding a 'buffer' of serotonin in the synapses so it's there when you need it for more even moods and less discomfort, but until that settles down it can be pretty trippy and stimulating (especially with sertraline that has a nice extra dopamine stimulatory effect, which is pretty helpful offsetting some of the more annoying SSRI side effects in the longer term). So if you feel like you're going to jump out of your skin now - yeah, that's normal, and it passes in about those 4-7 days (for me, anyway).

1362,5pqg8o,dcu0s45,Can someone who has been through depression describe what it is like to be done with it?. I just want to know what awaits us one day.,"I saw your post several hours ago and I've been thinking all afternoon about what you asked. I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now. There was a whole series of decisions and lessons and realizations I've made over a period of several years which probably merits its own post (or series of them). I joined this a short time ago and have been sort of lurking, trying to understand this community and seeing if I have anything to contribute, and your post makes me realize that maybe just telling my story will help others make their own way on their journey. To answer your specific question, the one thing I have come to understand is that there really isn't going to be a time when you are entirely done with it. There will always be a chance, however small, that you can fall back into it. However the longer you go without falling back in, the easier it gets. I tend to think of it in terms of black holes and orbital bodies. I'm going to have to create a post on that. The truths I've found is that recovery and freedom from depression is about breaking habitual negative lines of thought by replacing it with more positive ones. It's about learning how to recognize when you are falling back into the pit of depression, and being able to pull yourself back out. It's about accepting and finding value in yourself, and finding many many reasons to continue to be alive, to contribute and interact with the rest of the world. Coming from the other side, I understand so many things that I used to see as negative really don't have any sort of positive or negative connotation. That was all in my head. Often those negative connotations were put there by others, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes deliberately. I had to learn how to strip those ideas off and choose a new set of ideas to assign. I learned how to identify what kind of ideas were worth keeping and using, and which ones were not and discard them. I know this doesn't really explain much how I see things now, and how I no longer feel depressed all the time, but I promise to share my story in the hopes of helping you understand how I got where I am, and maybe help you make a similar journey.",0,,0,,2,"I'm not sure if I can fully explain the shift I made from being depressed and suicidal to the generally happy person I am now.

650,ag2rwr,ee379lw,"Is it supposed to be like this?. had depression since I was probably around 14. 38 now and I recall a time when I depressed.

Perhaps my age (and the fact that just sick of everyday life in general) that seems to have dulled life experience, maybe the seemingly constant barrage of tragedies and heavy personal baggage, but it seems like my doctors are just barely keeping me functional. It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end?

Off meds my bouts of deep depression were much sharper it seems. On meds it seems like everything is dulled. Perhaps my age (and the fact that just sick of everyday life in general) that seems to have dulled life experience, maybe the seemingly constant barrage of tragedies and heavy personal baggage, but it seems like my doctors are just barely keeping me functional. It feels like psychological life-support. My question is, is this what meds are supposed to be? Just little bumpers to keep you from falling off the deep end?

When she's ready to talk and when she talks to you, ask her if she wants help, and then get her help... now I know, I'm not a professional but from someone coming from the other side, I have a feeling that's what she would want. </target>"

The biggest struggle with depression is the isolation box it confines us in. It fools us into believing there is no one that will understand. Tells us not to burden others with our problems.

We feel lonely, hate that we feel lonely, feel stupid for looking weak, and decide to keep it hidden. We find worth in our connection to others.

Walking to school in the morning, thru classes all day, walking home in the afternoon, having dinner, staring into the void during homework time, staring at the ceiling at night trying to go to sleep, I had a huge pain in my chest and I was alone. </target>"

Sometimes, even friends can feel like a burden to some people. Doesn't mean they hate their friends, it just drains them to constantly have to cater to their friends to keep them. Maybe being in bed is just your favorite activity. You're addicted to it, just like people being addicted to video games. It makes you feel good to just lie there, as opposed to everything else. When you leave it, you suffer withdrawals. In that case, your best bet is to force yourself for three weeks. I know it's hard, but that's literally the only way to change it. You can get someone to help you do it, if you have friends nearby that can knock on your door and be mean to you for a few weeks. Can you tell me more about your experience lying in bed? What you feel, what your thoughts are about not lying in bed? </target>"
2579,8iugtk,dyuqw32,Has medical marijuana worked for other peoples depression?. I'm just curious about peoples ideas on the matter.,"It helped at the beginning of my marijuana usage when I was smoking maybe 2-3 times a week but if it can spiral out of control pretty quickly to where it creates a vicious cycle of abuse. The marijuana also blew my anxiety through the roof. In my experience, the depression will come back once not high (and sometimes even worse than it was before getting high) which has the potential for psychological dependence. Within 9 months of beginning self medication I went from smoking like $10 worth 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day so beware. By the end of the 9 month period I was spending about $200 a week on weed.

You shouldn't fear not finding love. 'Cause that's just not how it works. I wouldn't say love finds you either, that's also not how it works. I wouldn't ponder too much about not finding the one or love. Time will tell, it will come. During that time, try to be alright with yourself by being just yourself. You want to be with someone because you want to be with them, not because you fear being lonely. Give it time. Talk to your friends. Enjoy yourself. </target>"
554,3zlyhc,cyn6pwj,I want to die. That's all I have to say,"Most of us on this have been/are there. I know i have. I tend to dwell on the past far too often and besides it's obvious drawbacks it does have one advantage. Remembering the time i did want to die and how I thought there was no other way out. But I decided to live and I haven't actually wanted to die since. Sure things suck, most of the time for longer than we'd like but there are alot of things that make life on this planet right now worth living. I personally am not religious. I think once your dead it's lights out and I very much enjoy consciousness. I only felt what it was like living without it once or twice and those were not pleasant experiences. I'm still technically Depressed, I have been most of my life and likely will be until it's over or I find what it is i need to do with myself to get there. What helped me go from uber frustrated to content is to continue to evolve. I cut off everyone i knew and reevaluated what I want in life... Apparently it's living in a van and not staying anywhere long enough to feel stagnant. I'm not at all a people person and i have a family full of happy go lucky dimwits who talk nonsense and gossip repeating the same routine like that i what life is. That's not what i want. To be happy you need to forget about everyone and their bullshit, and be who you are where you are. Experience what life is, don't waste it and don't throw it away before you've lived it fully. I'm stuck right now, been hibernating as my little brothers personal housekeeper because my anxiety drives me to near agoraphobia. But once i get out of here I'll take all the lessons I've learned on /r/vandwellers and start my life as i know it should be and hopefully that brings me piece of mind for once. That's what works for me, but if your not an antisocial INTP then you might not want to live in a van lol. But I'm sure there is some way you see life should be... There's an entire world out there, look at the room around you and remember that's less than a microbe in the grand scheme of things.

764,608rsl,df6xvka,Fuck. When you try to relate but you'd rather kill yourself.,"hi there, forgive me if I'm wrong with regards to what you are referring to. How I understand your statement is that you try to relate to others but rather do the latter. If this is the case, I want to let you know that even though sometimes you feel you are compelled to relate to other because of societal pressures, you really don't and it depends to what extent. It's important to be who you are and be with people where you can be who you are. But that doesn't mean your depressed you is who you are as a person. Your depression is only a part of who you are, not your defining being. Don't define yourself as 'a depressed person' but more so 'a person that has depression right now at this stage of my life.' Because depression goes away or can be managed very well where it doesn't intrude on your life in a daily or constant basis. You are much more than your depression. Try to take smell steps that you are comfortable with and learn some coping strategies in managing depressed feelings. Ideally it'll be great if you can see a therapist but I understand that has it's own restrains. The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this. I always tell others that healing isn't easy but it's worth it because you are worth it, whether you feel it right now or not.",1,"The key thing is to never give up on yourself because when you believe, there will be a way out of this.|",0,,0,,"<speaker> Fuck.

I'm in my early 20s. I think the fact that people my age are getting married left and right just kind of brings the issue to the forefront of my mind, but it doesn't really matter. Relationships and love are all bullshit anyways, just like pretty much everything in life. Maybe I just see things that way because I have had to experience life as myself. It's unfortunate, really. </target>"

What I try to do is work back on a route to the thing that would lead to getting the one thing that could be right. i.e. something that costs money makes you happy, but you don't make enough money; need a way to make more money; dedicate all free time to applying for better work. Or, feel lonely and haven't got anybody; need to find somebody to stop feeling like that; need to know best places to find somebody; research ways to meet people and put self into that situation.

Comparing yourself to others is a race to the bottom, somebody is always 'worse' off in your eyes because you dont value yourself as much as you do other people, your mind down plays your own successes and overplays others. The hard bit is convincing yourself that is the case, fuck even I'm not convinced and I have some self awareness of why I feel the way I do, it's hard man. Your feelings are real and you dont need to prove otherwise to anybody but yourself. </target>"

908,4orouw,d4f0lyw,Does anyone know how to study when they're depressed?. I can't find the strength to do anything. It's almost as if my mind has turned off.,"That has to be tough. It's different strokes for different folks of course but I might have a suggestion. I find my depression tends to be racing negative thoughts. My understanding is that there are two default brain modes, one is random thought, day dreaming for example, and the other is processing. So you need to switch from day dreaming to processing, and that is hard for everyone. Start with meditation. Close your eyes for 5min and focus on your breathing. If your thoughts drift from breathing, then shut it down n snap back to breathing. Don't get emotional, just stay calm and focus on breathing. When finished, move everything that is a distraction away from you. No phone, no internet if possible, just clear that shit away and start studying as if it is your breathing. This focus is just like a muscle and the more you flex the stronger it will become. Don't expect to focus for hours on end, but try to catch yourself when you drift and get back to that focus. Also make studying fun, or less boring. Take notes, highlight pages, repeat the things you read. Most importantly, try telling a story with what you are learning. It's a strong method for memorization. People with ordinary memories use stories and codes to memorize full decks of cards in minutes.

Being terminally ill for the past 7 years (Im 42 now) the physical pain of a slow and horrible illness has led to my depression and desire to die. It is up to my wife though. And for her I live every day in hell. When you have even one person to keep you going, it can be enough. I am a lurker here and I read posts to give me perspective. Rarely can I physically reply. But what my experience being bound to a bed 24/7 has taught me is that once I made my peace with dying, I became indifferent to everything. For myself It's been tough to see people truly depressed to the point of wanting to die. I am very empathetic, but my depression is a symptom so its hard to understand. The one thing I do understand though is that the last thing you want to hear is Don't do it!!! Call this number... or other similar programmed/indoctrinated responses. So just know this... The world and life can be one big shitshow... So it helps to keep toilet paper handy. Let your friend be your toilet paper and be your friends toilet paper. It will be enough.  Lastly... Just remember that no matter how bad life feels (and is...) even I am artificially grateful for the fact that I have a far better life right now (suffering from *pain and bound to a bed), than 99.999999% of all humans to have ever lived.

So give yourself a list of requirements that must be met for you to end it all. *- Pain so severe that causes me to vomit my own feces at times as it sends my body into shock. I wish you the best. I hope you can suffer less in time if possible. You and I are here right now... That makes us stronger than those who gave up yesterday. (And if you do one day come to the realization that you must go, make sure to do it in a way that allows your organs be given to help others. It helps me knowing that maybe I will have something that can give a healthy, long, and amazing life for a person who is still able to live it. ) Just think about making the list...

701,6pos8l,dkrzdpi,I showered today for the first time this week. I still feel like shit,"I think people are meant to regularly bathe. Like we have probably been bathing while still hairy and grunting. I wasn't raised the best; one thing is that I was never taught to bathe regularly. It was normal to bathe once every 2-4 weeks growing up. Basically, I never had it ingrained into me, which led to being super hygienic to the point of irritation and skin problems during puberty, and complete abandonment of hygiene during my intense depressive periods.

When you go to the supermarket, fast food is not an option. You will not spend your money on that shit. No chips, no sweet stuff, no special drinks.

None of my problems have ever been that bad, but they have been the biggest problem I ever faced. They always seem overwhelming because I don't know how to handle failure of rejection of really any kind of pain or even mild discomfort. I am a wimp. And yet, they still treated me at the hospital - multiple times. I was never told to suck it up; I was taken seriously and given the help I need. It isn't about the external circumstances, it's about how we react to them. So if you need help, *that's okay*. You aren't any less of a person. You are worth just as much as anyone else. Someone losing their home or family in Texas doesn't mean your problems are irrelevant at all! </target>"

3049,7nxgp1,ds58dos,one question. I'll keep it simple. Can there be happiness in despair? Because I think I felt it and I want to kill off any hope that's left for me.,"That's a pretty profound question, but I think happiness is something that a lot of people don't understand. In a period or prolonged period of despair, I don't believe there can be happiness at all, and it's only after that period has been solved, over, attacked enough by effort and time, that you can start experiencing happiness. I don't think happiness and gratitude should be forced, or you should try to feel happy when you truly cannot feel happy. I'm still going through that period, and there might be rivets or jewels of happiness along the way, but they are fleeting and leave very quickly. The whole reason why people despair is because they are tied so strongly to negative emotional memories that they outweigh any trivial positive emotional memories. Think about it, which memories are the quickest, strongest, and most easily able to be remembered for you? The most emotional ones. If your most emotional memories are negative, you will be in despair. On the converse, if one's most emotional memories are positive, you will be in a state of happiness. There is a way to end your despair, you just have to face it head on and let go of everything, and keep trying to let go and accept. Very few people have any science on this and might be the thing we need to explore the most as a society as a whole.",1,,0,,2,I'm still going through that period|,"<speaker> one question.

It could be a simple as just playing the shit out of a stupid flash game, or clearing out all the spam in your email, or reorganising your room. Just find something to keep yourself moving. Writing can help too, just lay it all out there. Seeing your words outside your head can help break the downward spiral of thinking. If it's worse now then that means was better, and it will be eventually. Think of someone you can talk to, who knows you well, and just hit them up and say hi. Maybe a text, maybe an email, just remind yourself that you are not alone. It's a shitty battle but stick it out if you can. If you have a therapist try reaching out to one, and if you don't then see if you can get a friend or a parent to help you find one. There's nothing magic about professional help, but it does work sometimes and that's reason enough to get the process rolling if you feel like you can. Send me PM if you want to vent more or anything, you're not alone and you can survive this </target>"

I really didn't ask to be born and then my parents put this life responsibility on me. Anybody else feel like this?,"omg lol I 100% blame my parents. After taking an AP Psychology course at my school, it kind of shifted my own perspective on my depression. I know I can't claim to be an expert after reading just one textbook, but even an idiot can realize that your behavior and who you are is just totally as a result of your parents. The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process. Strangely, being cognizant of that fact doesn't change it much. Of course, I've directly told my parents I blame them for who I am, and as perfect specimens, they told me that I can't keep blaming them for everything.

The genetic aspects aren't their fault of course, but they are perfect human specimens, so you can imagine what 17 years of always being wrong has done to my self esteem and thought process.

You gotta give yourself more time to do stuff because there will be days where you just do work.

Practice self care and indulge in the fee things that make you feel okay. stay in your dorm/apartment constantly.

If you like to write, start roleplays with people on geeking or rolemance and reply when you need a break from academic writing. Otherwise indulge in low energy hobbies.

Temporary problem, my ass.","This stuff all exists on a spectrum, so maybe arriving at some place of being totally better is not what it seems. I've had hardcore depression for many years, but I have definitely moved the bar significantly (without meds and without getting what i want in life or something, like a great relationship) which I can confirm especially in the moments when my external circumstances are going terribly, but i dont fall into 6 months of suicidal morbidity. I see depression (speaking only for myself here) as a product of thoughts and meanings. The same thing can happen to two people, and a depressed person will give it an incredibly dark meaning, whereas a non depressed person might give it a neutral or positive one. To me, growth out of depression is when you are finally grasping the arbitrary nature of meaning, and the impersonal nature of thought, and can start to make conscious rather than automatic decisions about what kind of meanings and thoughts you feed and go with (even arbitrarily). So, I arbitrarily decide to look at failing as good, because it gives me good reference experiences, rather than as evidence that i am worthless. Things like that. I still struggle a lot, but there is overwhelming evidence that you can slowly climb out of the hole with very hard inner work, and that the things that would have previously sent you down the spiral become more like non issues.

I can create meaning with my life: I can set up goals and pursue them. This is subjective, dynamic meaning that is ever-changing, but it is my meaning, and it is meaning in life. To compare these accomplishments to something infinite will always make them seem meaningless, but that's only because you changed the frame of reference. </target>"

I'm curious to know how y'all did it.,"I watched a short video once (I'm sure can google but I'm on phone and about to get in car) that compared depression to a big black dog. On bad days the dog is giant and weighing you down and on better days the dog is small and at your feet. This helped me accept a lot more about my life and my depression rather than constantly wishing it could just go away. I would get so mad at myself for being angry/sad but now I know it's like owning an animal--you take care of it and it won't bite you, at least not as much anyway. It's part of who you are and that is okay. I do not have severe depression so I am not on meds, so can't speak for those folks who are, but for me exercise and doing things for me (rather than constantly for others or other people's approval) really helped. It's like learning to be selfish in a good way. Eating less carbs and gluten helped too as they tended to make my body more sluggish which did t help when I already felt sad/slow/tired. I eat a lot more protein and fresh veggies now and I think there is a big difference--especially after 6+ months. I still drink alcohol but now a limited variety of stuff that I truly like the flavor of rather than eh it's here so I'll drink it. Also I don't drink when I'm in a bad place or anything traumatic happened that day/week. It's just a recipe for bad. I don't do any other drugs and I'm allergic to smoke so can't speak on that.

You are strong enough to survive, you can make it, but you have to believe in yourself. Don't let people, or work, or circumstance dictate you. Only let yourself dictate who you are. You can do this </target>"

3002,ain7uq,eepg5ut,Emotionally abused people. Please tell me your stories if you feel like it. Who abused you? How it affects you? I want to prove myself that my case is not that bad and i can make it.,"I'm game and need to vent so here goes... I was verbally, physically and emotionally abused for as long as I can recall. Since you asked about emotional abuse I will focus solely on that. I was blamed constantly for everything that was wrong with the family. My mother told me this numerous times after she and my father would have huge, physically violent fights that started over events that had nothing to do with me. I was constantly told If you had a brain you would be dangerous. by my mother. Not after I'd done anything, not after a stupid act or action on my part but just in passing. This was my mother's assesment of me and she told me this frequently. I was tested, determined to have a high IQ, placed in gifted and talented classes and made to suffer for it by narcissistic, superficial, egotistical mother for my entire life. If I vot an A I was told it was because the work was too easy for me, if I got a B it was because I was lazy and never applied myself. I would constantly be accused of thinking I was So smart. Nothing I ever did or attempted to do was good enough, there was always some flaw in it. I only received criticism, never any praise. In 4th grade I had lovely long hair, my mother decided I should have it all cut off. She took me to a beauty school and had them cut all of my hair off, a boy cut, they shaved the back of my neck. My mom cried afterward and said she was crying because The haircut showed how ugly I was. The next week we were going into our small town to pick up this giant fancy framed picture for our living room, My mom made me walk on the opposite side of the street after we got out of the car. She said, I don't want to be seen with you and have people know you are my daughter. My mother really values externak beauty. I was a skinny unremarlable child, I never forgot the other side of the street incident, I had to look at the damn framed picture that we picked up that day until I moved away from home and got married at age 19. Every time I saw it I thought of that day. Years of torture. I was a divorced single mother, my ex never paid a dime, not any of the support we were supposed to receive. I worked two jobs to support us. I never received any financial help from anyone. I crafted a nice career for myself and tried to be a good mom and a good person. I never drank, never did drugs or ran around or went wild or got in any trouble. But my mother was/is ashamed of me and made/makes sure to let me know it. Anyone she talks about to me she lets me know how successful their children are, how wealthy they are and how proud the parents are. My mom told me one day how disappointed she was with how I'd turned out, how she always thought I'd be someone when I grew up. She said she'd hoped I would've grown up to marry a doctor or lawyer or someone important. I told her I was someone. At the time I was an online database adminstrator with a nationally recognized nonprofit but to my mother I was an embarrassment, a nothing and a nobody. My mother's father, my grandfather was one of the only people in my life that was always kind to me, he treated me like I was special and had value. My mother knew I adored him and she hated that he liked me. After he died she insisted on telling me horrible things about him saying she wanted me to know what kind of man the grandfather I worshipped really was and that I should not feel special that some thing like him tolerated me better than most. Right after I was divorced, I was not yet employed full time and very poor. I was visifing my parents at their huge house in the country. My mother started bitching about how poor I was, I had not asked her or dad for a dime and I was not there to eat. Mom started talking about dying, asked me if I had a sill, etc.. Mom told me I better not die because she did not want to have to spend her money on a funeral for me, and she said not that anyone would show up at a funeral for me anyway. She also told me that she'd always thought of me as a living abortion, since my birth. She was going nuts, yelling and spitting. She told me she bet I was so poor, such a failure that I probably could not even afford feminine products. I got my purse to leave, opened it and hurled a few tampons at her, as I told her, wrong bitch. My father blocked the front door, and tried to make me apologise to my mother. I had to threaten to call the police before he would let me go. After my father passed away my mother called, she said she needed to ask me something. Then mom said, Did you ever think or get the feeling that your father really loved you or cared about you? I told my mom that yes, yes I did. That dad was a fifties guy and although he may not have ever been emotionally demonstrative I thought he did love and care about me. He has worked hard and made personal sacrifices to care for us financially when I was young. That there had been a few occassions that he'd been very nice to me. Like going into a shop and buying me a top he knew I wanted for my 16th Birthday. Buying me a computer, working with me on computer projects early on, buying us both laptops, teaching me to shoot and fish, and by his having special nicknames and greetings for me, etc.. I told mom that was how dad expressed his love. My mother said, That's interesting because I always had the impression that he didn't care about you at all. I was also emotionally abused by my father, it was different than my mother's abuse though. My dad alwsys had to be the best. He could not stand for me to be good at anything I could never, ever be as good as he was or (god fobid it) better. My parents were never involved in our education. They basically just asked us at dinner how school was and we'd say OK and dinner would proceed. I should have known from past events not to dare say anything positive had happened but one day I was happy and excited about something that had happened at school, in English class. I was so excited that I stupidly spoke up at dinner. When the standard, How was school? question was asked I boldly said, School was great, Mrs. G, my English teacher pulled me aside after class. She told me a poem I'd written for an assignment was so good they want my permission to publish it on the first page of the student yearbook! My father put his fork down, he tilted his head, gave me a bizarre look and told me to recite the poem. I could not recite it, I was too nervous and afraid. I said I would show it to him after dinner, it was no big deal. No, dad wanted to hear this fabulous poem I had written, right then. I went and got the poem and started to read it out loud. Dad told me to give it to him to read. He told me if it was in the yearbook people woukd be reading it for themselves. Dad read it silently and then while scoffing and half laughing he read it aloud. Dad asked me if the idiots at my school really thought that was good writing? He said he bet he could write something right then that would be a hundred times better. Dad left the table and went to his desk while we all sat at the table waiting for his return. After about twenty minutes Dad cheerfully returned, poem in hand. He stood and read it to us. It was some lame poem with Brother can you spare me a dime as one of the lines. Dad then told us, See, that's a poem, that's what good poetry is like! After that he asked all of us, Wasn't my poem better, a lot better? We all agreed, and lied and said his poem was a lot better. I told the English teacher not to let them use my poem for the yearbook. I never wrote another poem or much else for that matter. That crap happened in 1975 and I am still not over it despite counseling. Another thing that was a form of emotional abuse was the family hierarchy. My father came first, then my sister or mother, then me. I.always came last, even though I was the eldest child. There was this thing with the food. If we had any serving size type of meat it came into play. Let's say it is steaks for dinner, they are on a platter. The largest steak is for Dad, younger sister gets the next largest, mom third largest and smallest was for me. It was like that with all of the food. It was an unwritten rule. I decided to challenge it once when the platter of Hamburgers was beside me. I knew better than to go for the one for Dad but tried to take the secind largest one. My mom was immediately shrieking at me, No, no, put that back, it's for your sister! Yours is the small one. My parents home has our family pictures hanging in the study, they are hung vertically on one wall. The order is from top to bottom, a picture of my dad, a picture of my mom, a picture of my sister, a picture of my son, then a picture of me. I.am at the very bottom, like always. I.endured physical, emotional and mental abuse. I've seen therapist on occasion over the years and at one point was in therapy sessions twice a week for a year. It helped but it hasn't enabled me forget. I just have to deal with what happened and move forward. I'm not social, I don't really trust anyone or have any close friends but I'm okay with that.
