Thanks for chatting! bye </listener> <target> have a good one! bye </target>","<speaker> I really am not sure how I feel about this article. I think that parents in this situation need to face some type of punishment. </speaker> <listener> Why do you feel that way? </listener> <speaker> Because it is a case of negligence at the core. </speaker> <listener> Because they left a window open and the toddler pushed through the screen? I know that jumping toward negligence is a common emotional reaction to situations like this, but I think that you're misplacing blame in this instance. </listener> <speaker> Is it not negligent to make sure the window is closed/access blocked? That's like driving down the road with the door open and blaming the kid when they fall out. </speaker> <listener> In my view, a screen should provide enough security to allow the parents to leave the window open, you're analogy doesn't track. Perhaps they were just trying to keep their children's room cool on a balmy summer night. Accidents like this happen all the time. If you're intent on holding someone accountable then their really isn't anyone else to blame, but sometimes things just happen. </listener> <speaker> If you live multiple stories up then you should not leave a window open and if you do access needs to be blocked. Screens are obviously not a deterrent. So yes I think that parents in this situation should be forced to take parenting classes. </speaker> <listener> Most windows are up high enough on a wall that a child could not just walk through them. The child obviously stacked things inside the room to bring himself to window level and then pressed on the screen hard enough (this would take significant force on a properly installed screen) to fall through the window. The child was also four years old, right? At four, most children would have the presence of mind not to engage in such an activity. This is an odd circumstance all things considered. It's terrible to think of a dead child in any context. </listener> <speaker> Hard to think about this situation for sure. We cannot really assume how high the window was or how intelligent the child is though. This is for the parents to do. Which brings me back to my point, if you know your kid has the ability to engage in such a behavior, take precautions. My little brother burnt our house down when he was 4. My parents always had child proof lighters after that. There are a ton of examples that can be used but it always comes back to the parents. </speaker> <listener> I understand your point, but punishing the parents isn't going to bring the child back. I think that every parent could benefit from education on the basics of child rearing. </listener> <speaker> Right so the ""punishment"" would be more bringing awareness to the parents. Rather than jail time/cps involvement you make them take parenting classes to prevent this from happening again. </speaker> <listener> I'm pretty sure that they are very aware of the dangers following the events. The real shame is that humanity in general is a very reactive instead of a proactive entity.

These people are largely animals and I don't really care whether the Houthis are killed or the civilians are killed.  The lowlife people get what they deserve.  The Houthis are backed by Iran, however, so I'm obviously cheering for the coalition, since this is basically a proxy war between Iran and people less awful than them (which is literally everyone).  But the thing is, I think war should be war.  We won WW2 by showing no mercy . We leveled towns.  We nuked Japan twice.

How do you think police and race relations can be handled better? </listener> <speaker> I don't think they can directly. They are symptoms of a larger problem. </speaker> <listener> This is why NFL players were taking a knee. </listener> <speaker> Yes, even though that was co-opted to become about being anti-patriotic... </speaker> <listener> I know the police know how to take people in alive, look at most mass shooters. </listener> <speaker> True. Now, I believe that there are way more good police than bad, but it's obvious that some people are attracted to police work because it gives them a gun and the license to use it in public without fear of retribution </speaker> <listener> I agree that there are good police. I think they should be held to a high standard </listener> <speaker> Yes. Really, again, these are just symptoms though. Most of these social conflicts are really just proxies for the real problem, which is wealth disparity, which leads to scapegoating </speaker> <listener> Yeah, most super rich people do not care what happens to people no matter what their race is. </listener> <speaker> Yeah, or rather they only care so far as it keeps them entrenched in the 1% </speaker> <listener> I always wonder when enough money is enough. </listener> <speaker> Well, it's tough, because competition and profit fuels development, but it's a fact that wages have been stagnate (or even dropped against the value of the dollar) since the mid-90s </speaker> <listener> Jeff Bezos could pay more, but he rather see the fake number go up in his bank account. </listener> <speaker> Ha, oh, that number is very real... </speaker> <listener> Can he withdraw 75 billion dollars?. At some point it is just a number in account. I see your point too. </listener> <speaker> Yeah, all you need to know about what Bezos thinks of people is look at mturk: we're all busting our butts in bubble hell to sniff minimum wage - but, at least I can do it in my robe... </speaker> <listener> Do you think all this class,race is just part of the human condition? </listener> <speaker> That's an interesting question. Probably. I often say that if you want to know what humanity is about, just look around at what we do. We are what we do. But, a lot of it is due to developing in a climate of scarcity, where there is the perception that there are not enough to go around (which really should not be true anymore). </speaker> <listener> I agree. I think people are just scared to let their guard down because they do not want to lose what they have. </listener> <speaker> Yes. It's tough. But, what is going to happen in 20 years when automation, robotics, and AI eliminates A LOT of jobs. WE're already nearing a tipping point. What happens when there are simply not enough jobs for people anymore? </speaker> <listener> Hopefully universal basic income. </listener> <speaker> Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Basically, a form of socialism, but it's hard to get there without a real economic collapse. As long as it functions somewhat, then we're stuck with the current economic model, which means more racial scapegoating and more violence. </speaker> <listener> Sadly I have to agree with you. Most American think health care is not a right. </listener> <speaker> Yeah, and that's the problem. We're just content with what we're given. </speaker> <listener> Police departments and Fire departments are forms of socialism but people don't complain about them. </listener> <speaker> Yeah, our values are just out of whack. But, again, it is who we are. We want to point a finger at some 'other', some boogeyman, because it's easier and safer than point a finger at a crooked system, because that seems like too big of a problem to solve. </speaker> <listener> The government has long stopped working in the interest of the common man. </listener> <speaker> True, but it's not just the government, it's everything, all of it. The whole structure and processes of society. It's a massive problem that will only be solved if we reach some crisis that necessitates huge change. </speaker> <listener> Climate change or an asteroid. </listener> <speaker> Yes, something at that level. People won't change unless their comfort is threatened. It doesn't have to be existential, but big enough to rattle everyone. </speaker> <listener> Do you think police should be enforcing laws dealing with what an adult does with their own body? </listener> <speaker> Well, I think there are way too many laws governing personal behavior. Most things that do not directly harm others should be legal. Abortion. Suicide. Gambling. Prostitution. Some drugs. Legalize, regulate and tax. The problem isn't the act themselves, it's the criminality, which breeds abuse and exploitation, because where can you turn if you know that what you're doing could get you locked up? </speaker> <listener> I can see how see how some women can be forced into prostitution. I believe all drugs should be legal. I would hate for one of my children to overdose, but I would also hate for one of my children to die from a heart attack from eating Big Macs all day which is not illegal. </listener> <speaker> Yes, that's right. Our society shouldn't punish people for making what others would deem to be a mistake. It should be more forgiving and permissive. Drug addition should not be a criminal matter - it should be viewed as a public health matter. </speaker> <listener> Do you think we should make police less militarized? </listener> <speaker> Probably, but I also think that there should be way more police. And, yeah, the role of police should shift away from 'catching bad guys' to supporting communities. </speaker> <listener> Like back in the day when they knew the people's names in the community. </listener> <speaker> Yes, exactly - I also think that police should live in the precincts they work in. </speaker> <listener> I agree with that. </listener> <speaker> Well, ti was really cool chatting with you.

I'm kinda picky about meat so this is disgusting to think about. </speaker> <listener> I guess if I had to I would if it was a choice between a dog and people Ill pick the dog lol </listener> <speaker> well yes certainly.  Hopefully it never comes to that.  I do find it a bit alarming that people in countries like Korea or wherever are like breeding dogs just to eat them.  That is foul.  Anyway, </speaker> <listener> haha that is foul I grew up in the hood and that shit is foul </listener> <speaker> Yes it is totally not okay.  Anyway, maybe there should be some restrictions on dogs people are allowed to own.  I would get behind that. </speaker> <listener> dogs should be banned unless used to hunt other animals </listener> <speaker> I don't really like dogs so I could get behind banning dogs altogether, too.  I doubt that will happen though.  Well it has been great discussing this with you but I must go.  Have a great rest of your day, goodbye </speaker> <target> goodbye </target>",1.0,1.0,0.6667,417.0,33.0,That was a sad story wow that was terrible what happened to that poor dog but then again I hate dogs so I'm glad its one less dog left on this planet if it were up to me I would shoot all the stupid ugly dogs that are out there I can not believe people keep them as pets they should eat them like they do in china,4.0,3.875,724.0

Some victims are too ashamed to say anything. </listener> <speaker> Yep I agree, but the ones who are fabricating it and doing it for attention are ruining it for the genuine victims </speaker> <listener> I suppose so. But we can't really punish women for coming forward just because they don't have proof. </listener> <speaker> No, you can't punish them, but honestly in my opinion you can't treat a man as though he's guilty unless there is proof.  But unfortunately, once these people make their allegations the public basically treats the person as though they are guilty and their life is destroyed, and often their career and the lives of their family members.  So to me it is just very sad.  And it scares me for my sons.  My husband doesn't even want to be around women at work bc he is scared someone might make up some allegation.  THAT is a hostile environment and unfair to men. </speaker> <listener> That's true, there needs to be proof before punishment. Anyone who is fired for something like that without proof should be able to sue for wrongful termination. </listener> <speaker> Yes they should.  But I do understand what you're saying about the true victims and the predicament they are in.  I Just think it's a very sad situation for everyone and it's distressing that this is an issue in our society now. </speaker> <listener> It is definitely a difficult situation. </listener> <speaker> Yes really without any good solution.

I think the #metoo movement has gone too far honestly.  I find a lot of these allegations highly questionable and I'm skeptical.  In this case, her roommates from the time period do recall her mentioning it supposedly so there seems to be some validity there.  But you just never really k now with these things, especially when it's brought up twenty years later.  Seems like a lot of women just do this for attention or whatever weird reasons they might have. </speaker> <listener> In this case in particular, it's something she mentioned before so that makes it more likely to be true I think. It's really difficult because it's not like it's easy to prove things like this. </listener> <speaker> Yeah totally.  It comes down to a ""he says, she says"" in so many cases.  I agree that the fact that she mentioned it at the time lends some credibility to the story.  I just feel like so many men have been unfairly crucified by this whole movement. </speaker> <listener> In some cases maybe. Or maybe more women are just speaking up when they were afraid to before, since it's so hard to prove one way or the other. </listener> <speaker> I would guess a little bit of both, but it could also be that more women are wanting to fabricate things and get int he spotlight bc they see it happening with other women </speaker> <listener> I guess it's hard to imagine anyone would want to be recognized for something like that. I mean you never know, I guess. What do you think a woman should do if she's been a victim but has no proof? It's pretty easy to just grab or touch someone without anyone else seeing </listener> <speaker> I find it very easy to believe someone would want to be recognized for that.  People will do anything for attention.  Look at reality TV and social media.  I think people should report things when they happen, not 20 years later. </speaker> <listener> Sure, that would be helpful but even then if you have no proof it doesn't really matter if it just happened does it?
