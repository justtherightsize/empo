229,1.5,"Apologies that this isn't really fitness-related but I need a place to vent and you guys have always been a good community.

My mom called me last night and informed me that the lump they found on my dad's neck is cancerous. He's getting scanned this week and they'll know the extent of the cancer (i.e. if it's spread).

I don't know guys. I'm 20, in my last year of college, and thousands of miles from home. I haven't been home in months, and won't be again until the summer. Apparently this type of cancer is pretty much only seen in smokers/heavy drinkers, and my dad is absolutely neither of those things. He goes to the gym, eats healthy, and takes care of himself.

I had a pretty serious existential crisis (re: our mortality) last night. Has anyone experienced this after hearing grave news? How do you deal with how frail and unpredictable our lives are? As much as I want to, I don't believe in an afterlife, nor am I religious, so I can't find solace in that.","Hey, I had basically the same thing happen to me. My dad had a cancerous lump on his neck when I was 15ish. I don't think the fear of mortality ever really goes away, but it is a good reminder to not wait to do what you love. 

On the flip side, cancer treatment is not what it used to be. When my dad was treated 10 years ago, the radiation and chemotherapy was crippling. It took a long time and left him with side effects that still bother him. His hair fell out, the whole 9. This year, when my mom was treated using chemo, she felt tired and had nerve pain, but it wasn't nearly as bad. Cancer treatment is much more sophisticated now. 

Cancer sucks, and it's scary as hell. If you want to talk to me about it, feel free to shoot me a message, now, or months from now.

592,1.5,"Good morning ladies. I’m having a rough day. Keto is going well. Shark week is almost over but I can’t stop crying. I love my job but twice on the way to work today I thought about sending in a letter of resignation. I’m trying to think of a way out of dinner plans with some girlfriends who I adore tomorrow night. 

I think it all comes from the fact that I have to do a sleep study tonight. After working 10 hours today, I have to go and sleep somewhere with a bunch of people watching me because I snore. I hate being fat. I wish I’d committed to keto sooner so I’d be able to see my husband and kids tonight instead of this stupid sleep study. 

I’m wondering...has anyone been treated for sleep apnea and then been able to go off pap after losing weight? 

Maybe I could reschedule it for a few months out and just focus on my diet and exercise until then and not need it at all.","I’m sorry about your day :( 

My dad was pretty overweight and had the sleep study, he was upset about being diagnosed with sleep apnea but when you are so tired you fall asleep at the wheel... you gotta suck it up lol. But since then he has lost a ton of weight and watches what he eats, I’m very proud of him. He loves his machine! He saw such a big difference in his life with it and that happiness made the transition not so bad. I don’t know if he ever got retested trough.

Hello everyone. I've gained about 50 pounds over the last year, during and following the loss of my father (ALS). I suffer from major depressive disorder, and the state of my body is a major contributing factor.

I have had minor success with keto in the past, I enjoyed the diet but my girlfriend and I talked ourselves into a cheat day (thanks, North Korea), and never went back on it.

I find myself struggling with confidence in starting the plan. I know I want to do it, but I don't believe I can. How did you all make it over the hump?","I'm so sorry for your loss!  As for restarting, don't treat yourself like someone who has done keto before successfully.

Treat yourself like a brand new ketoer, which means forgot all the hacks and recipes you ended up using at the end of your journey - bring back all the basics and start fresh.

Meat, veggies, cheese.

Don't count calories for the first two weeks while your body adapts. When your hunger starts to recede, break out the food scale and start weighing and measuring, and track with an app you like (I like cronometer).

Think about what you're eating. Be mindful. If you're inspired to cheat, stop and think about it - really think about the fact that cheating is self-sabotage, and what's going on in your life that would make you think ""hey, I don't deserve to make a healthy choice - I only deserve to do something that will make me feel guilty later"".

But that was a really fucked up moment, where his doctor in the evaluation was able to say ""i think we can both agree you just made a poor decision to say/threaten those things, and otherwise you understand why that's not something you'll do again out of anger - if I am to give you a medicine to help a condition that I don't believe exists, we could be actively doing you harm. Come back and talk to me next week and we'll see how you feel. ""  


So it turned into a small set of therapy sessions and they cleared him... I'm glad he went along with it, and didn't ""resist"" as I believe he would have been forced into a hospital or something.   


Sure, he may have needed that therapy, but reading your experience just immediately made me imagine a different outcome for him... one more similar to yours.   


Again, glad you are in a better place now.

",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> I was going through what I would call “normal adolescence” but my mom thought it was something more severe like bilpolar disorder.  So I was taken to this doctor who listened more to her than me, and I was given drugs to take.  Seroquil was just one of them I was on during this period.  There are long stretches of time that I don’t even remember anymore, including the beginning of the relationship with my wife and high school sweetheart.  I’m doing better now, 10 years later, but it’s still something I have to deal with. </speaker> <listener> Sorry this happened to you, glad you are in a better place now

32,1.5,"My boyfriend just broke up with me. The day before Valentine’s Day. And I put my dog down Thursday. Kind of numb . I hope it goes away soon. How long did the pain last for you? I know we’re all different but I’m just searching for answers 

UPDATE: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. Man, I never thought I’d have such amazing support. I feel like I grew new skin just reading everyone’s comments and messages. My nausea is subsiding with every motivational comment. Wow thanks Reddit!","It's been about 7 months for me and I'd say I'm in the 4th wave of depression. Although it wasn't until October that I really knew there was no chance of getting back together and was let down in many ways at that time, so I guess this is the 3rd wave since October.

Each wave gets easier. The shitty thing is that even though it gets easier and you get over it quicker each time, you unfortunately tell yourself oh it's easier this time and then BAM you still get hit with these sharp sad moments, and that makes you feel hopeless because you thought you had more control over it and wouldn't hit that rock bottom again. So the storms are calmer each time, but they still have lightning.

Now what I've noticed makes things better is of course a good sleeping schedule, healthy eating, exercising, but also change of any kind. These are the moments in life when change is almost necessary. I knew I had to learn from my breakup, there are things about myself that no one likes and ***I don't like***, so what better time to change things than when I'm painfully aware of these flaws and doing the same things/being the same way has hurt me in the past, I'm sadly aware in the present by reliving those moments where the flaws were most apparent, and I know these flaws will hurt future relationships. I will also say that I never did well with change of any form, and I believe that people who like change are more successful and happy (just an anecdote), so I'm actually starting to enjoy change and believe that embracing and accepting change will only help me in life. 

Even though I wish I was never hurt this bad, it has really forced me to change a lot of things for the better- I used to work with my ex and quit that job because I was reminded of her too much (but hey the job sucked and now I'm looking for something better), I don't go to any of the places we used to eat or hangout (it's forcing me to try new places), it made me want to move (she joined the Navy and talked me into it as well, which I'm thankful for so I might get to see the world). 

Remember, I know some people do have it much easier than others, but for **most** people life is fucking hard. Again life is fucking hard and that's okay because we can get used to it and have really amazing moments where everything is worth it. I mean as absolutely heartbroken as I am after being hurt so bad, I'm still convinced that this girl is my soul mate, and I still would do it all over again, because that short time that we were together was truly the best time of my life and the happiest I've ever been. Looking back at life, how many people get to say they honestly feel like they met their soul mate?

Baby measures at 8-9weeks.  3 days ago we confirmed what we already knew from the day before with OB.  At that visit, doc recommended that we try and ""pass"" the baby naturally vs. doing D&amp;C.

306,1.0,"Awesome! Not to worry.  My husband had a tripod dog that could out jump his larger dogs... right over 6 foot fences. There are lots of astounding dogs... and humans always have the harder time adjusting.

I don’t mean to come off all know it all. I lost my german shepherd mix to a rapid growth tumor recently after a few years of him being a special needs dog. He had seizures and severe arthritis and a few other minor things... and died before he was 7. The arthritis really limited his mobility a lot, but he was always happy as long as we were together. I miss him more than I can express. He could barely walk but he would make the effort to greet me even before he died and he had a 16 pound tumor inside.

My point being that dogs do have different personalities - so you might have a stoic, like my sheppy, or a drama queen like my shiba. But they will just adapt to whatever is going on at the time.  There are times I could barely keep from crying around my sheppy, as tough as he had it. Your shibe should be MUCH better off than my dog and a lot bouncier once he gets used to getting around.

Please post pics. 😁 would love to see more of your doggo!","You sound knowledgeable and not at all like a “know it all”!

In fact, these comments are exactly why I posted here. It helps knowing that other people have been in similar situations and knowing that we’re on the right path.

It’s a little tough going because I’m pretty analytical and, while preparing for the worst but hoping for the best, I just get a flood of memories of the situation he was in before I took him home and the long road we’ve taken to get here.

The news was sudden and that, along with the waiting and the feeling of helplessness, is what is upsetting.

I don’t mean to come off all know it all. I lost my german shepherd mix to a rapid growth tumor recently after a few years of him being a special needs dog. He had seizures and severe arthritis and a few other minor things... and died before he was 7. The arthritis really limited his mobility a lot, but he was always happy as long as we were together. I miss him more than I can express. He could barely walk but he would make the effort to greet me even before he died and he had a 16 pound tumor inside.

My point being that dogs do have different personalities - so you might have a stoic, like my sheppy, or a drama queen like my shiba. But they will just adapt to whatever is going on at the time.  There are times I could barely keep from crying around my sheppy, as tough as he had it. Your shibe should be MUCH better off than my dog and a lot bouncier once he gets used to getting around.

Please post pics. 😁 would love to see more of your doggo! </speaker> <listener> You sound knowledgeable and not at all like a “know it all”!

In fact, these comments are exactly why I posted here. It helps knowing that other people have been in similar situations and knowing that we’re on the right path.

It’s a little tough going because I’m pretty analytical and, while preparing for the worst but hoping for the best, I just get a flood of memories of the situation he was in before I took him home and the long road we’ve taken to get here.

The news was sudden and that, along with the waiting and the feeling of helplessness, is what is upsetting.

We just don’t want him to suffer or be scared and it’s important to us that we maintain his quality of life the best we can.

Wife and I are apparently taking turns on mental breakdowns. It breaks my heart when she's in tears holding the screaming baby in the middle of the night telling me ""I don't know what else to do"" and I don't know how to help either.

896,1.5,"So I'm fucked off at my father still. I'm actually contemplating borderline disowning the cunt as this stage.

A few of you know a few years back I postponed my application for Pre-Medicine to head back across the country to my home town and put my palliative nursing skills to service in looking after my last remaining grandparent, my Nana because my dad was running himself into the ground trying to be full time carer for himself and my mother who lives with a disability. And his sisters (my cunt aunts and extended family did fuck all to help)

At the time my Nana's prognosis was something like 6 months and so I thought after it had all came to pass I could go back to Melbourne as re-accept my deferred application. This also stops Nana going into hospice which was something that she and everyone else didn't want at the time. Being in a small town the home nursing services are incredibly limited and not really of help.

So I move in, 4 months in, she gets a diagnosis of spontaneously remission in her secondary cancer, (she had metastatic skin cancer, and her chemo/radiation combo gave her secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma), so her prognosis for an extended life is longer in that regard other than the increasing debilitation of her skin cancer.

So the best part of 5 years drag on, my Pre-Med Acceptance is declined. I'm a 24/7 live in nurse across all aspects of care and house keep for Nana so she doesn't have to be in a home. Little time off othe than a couple of chances to get away. No energy or time for a job as well, other than reddit, there wasn't much else to keep me sane. 

One week after the funeral the cunt aunts and my dad ask me to leave the house or start paying rent (bearing in mind i was not paid other than a small government stipened for looking after Nana for ll this time, which in hospice fees alone would have been $130k a year at least).... So they can sell the place asap and get the money. I move into a friends house, buy a car and drive across the country to move here. The house sits empty for 18 months. I get no family member saying thank you for looking after her, but her friends in the community did.

Now, Nana was cremated after the funeral service and it was her wishes to be returned to her home of The Isle of Wight in the UK and be scattered there. Her ashes have been sitting at my aunts until someone goes back to the UK or they mailed her because that's what she wanted.

I get a SKYPE message at 1.50pm my time yesterday from my cunt father that reads in part ""we are going to scatter (most) of your Nan's ashes today at 2pm in the river (of my home town) so she'll be with your Grandad. A small parcel of her ashes is on it's way to the Isle of Wight""...

I get NO prior warning so that I can be there, I get nothing. I spent the better part of 5 years looking after Nana when no one else was willing to, and informing her of her rights across her medical care and ability to make informed decisions in regards to her care instead of just making her or guilting her to  do shit like her fucking kids did... and I don't even get invited to see her final farewell.

When I asked why I or my sister wasn't told sooner, I got told that I couldn't have afforded to go over there anyway... I'm thinking in my mind: You fucking CUNT you were given over $120k in inheritance, you could have flown my sister and i over and back if you wanted us there....

I'm beyond pissed and upset. I know that if the tables were turned it would have been the worlds biggest drama.

I wish I had the magic cure. I can offer a listening ear. Message me anytime. I am rooting for you.

Just gotta keep your head up huh? Life is a constant war and you can't allow yourself to lose it. Can't give anybody an inch and you've gotta keep them at arm's length lest they get within striking distance.

I’m sorry about your break up and especially your dog. That’s horrible. As far as fights with mom, I can toast to that.

793,1.5,"I often lurk because I'm too lazy to sign in, but today I have decided to get some things of my chest, and this seems like the best thread to post about it. 

I'm Vietnamese. I was born there, but moved over here pretty young, so I'm the in between generation where everything is half American and half Viet. My identity is something I've always struggled with, but that is not the point of my post today. 

I want to speak about something a little darker. My mother has metastatic breast cancer. She was diagnosed back in May, but didn't tell me until I found her medical discharge papers when I came home from college. I speak conversational Vietnamese, nothing substantial to tell her how I really feel and to understand how she really feels. My house has always been just my mom and I. My dad is a functional alcoholic who I have never really been close to. My grandmother lives with us, and today, I was in the ER with her because we thought she had a stroke. There is so much death around me lately that I feel completely hopeless.

My mom is refusing chemotherapy, which to a certain extent, I understand. But she is also continuing to work at the nail shop no matter how much I dissuade her. It often leads to arguments. Lately, we only argue. I can't express myself well enough and she gets frustrated because I don't understand. She is the main source of income in our family and my schooling is paid by her. Her one wish is for me to graduate college. But honestly, at this rate, she might not live to see the end of this year, much less my graduation. She had me fairly late, so I'm an only child. I don't have any close cousins in age near me. My closest friends are not Asian, or if they are, have English speaking parents, so they don't understand how frustrating it is to not be able to communicate with someone. I am consumed by guilt all the time because I should have known better. I'm majoring in health sciences. I know the symptoms of breast cancer. She's been displaying them for years, but I never knew because she never wanted me to worry. I think all the time about how this could have been diagnosed earlier if I paid attention, if I spoke better Viet, or if were closer to her. 

I know I don't really get to feel this way and the best thing I can do is be there for her to support her, but I simply don't know how. The only person who knows she has cancer are her doctors, my dad, and I. I really want to reach out to my aunts  and uncles to ask for help or guidance, but I feel like I'm overstepping a boundary. She's lost fifty pounds and aged ten years. They all know something is wrong but my mom is so stubborn she doesn't tell them. In fact, it seems as if she's cut off contact with most of them. I don't know. What should I do? How do I be there for her? How do I convince her to get life saving treatment, or if she really doesn't wish it, tell her to stop working herself to death? I don't want her collapsing at the shop. I'm also worried to head back to college, but taking time off is not an option. I just feel so defeated. Sorry about the length and the darker topic, but I honestly don't know where else to turn to.","So sorry to hear what your mum and you are going through.

Then when I secretly recorded her actually picking a fight with me, I took the footage to the police where they threatened to throw me in jail for illegally filming her. 

Later, she broke up with me, filed a bogus ""protection from abuse"" order, took our son, and then complained to the judge that I left her for another woman. Oh, and I also found out that she'd been cheating on me for 13 years. But the judge didn't want to hear my side of things. I now have to pay about $1200 a month in child support.

Then when I secretly recorded her actually picking a fight with me, I took the footage to the police where they threatened to throw me in jail for illegally filming her. 

Later, she broke up with me, filed a bogus ""protection from abuse"" order, took our son, and then complained to the judge that I left her for another woman. Oh, and I also found out that she'd been cheating on me for 13 years. But the judge didn't want to hear my side of things. I now have to pay about $1200 a month in child support.

I used to think that it was crazy ""red pillers"" that used to say this stuff and before my child custody trial I told my friends (that claimed they went through this already) that they were out of their minds. They were exactly right.

12,1.0,It's hard to explain. But I've been lied to. Cheated on. The relationship is over. I feel like I did this. I didn't show my love. I didn't see the signs. I've never felt more autistic.,"You know what breaks my heart about this? Whatever you thought you showed him, it couldn't be more clear to anyone reading this that you loved him deeply. &lt;3

Here's some good news:
It sounds like you have a job situation that will distract you. A distraction is good for you right now.
It sounds like you have an important role and people count on you. That might provide you a boost.

I agree with everyone else - seeing professional help is a very good idea and anyone who is willing to take you there if good to reach out to if you can't bring yourself on your own.

When I was in a similar situation and reacted about the same way, my doctor prescribed Ativan. For me, that made the crippling anxiety go away, but also made it impossible for me to do any work. For me, I had a couple weeks where in the morning, I wasn't going to get any work done on or off Ativan. In the afternoon, I was calm enough to get some work done. (Was a freelance computer programmer at the time)

Another drug might have worked better, but I saw my therapist a few times, and within a few weeks, the anxiety was manageable again.

During the real bad time, I found that in the evening, I was finally able to keep food down.

Whenever you are able to eat, please do. Anything you can do to take care of yourself.

Exercise in any way you can. Unplug in any way you can for a few hours. If you can't write things out right away as another redditor suggested, were things all out when you can.

Battens is another genetic disease, it’s neurodegenerative,  so my eldest is 7, started loosing his eye sight last year, we expect seizures to start in the run up to 10, then in his teens his motor functions and cognition will decrease until he passes away some point in his late teens or 20’s.

648,2.5,"Gonna be real here...worst week of my life, haha. 

Gonna keep it relatively short because I don't want to bother anyone (hypocritical because I'm making the post to begin with), but I just broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years like...a few days ago. 

We had known she was moving to the states for months now, but we tried to pretend it wasn't happening. In retrospect, maybe should have broke it off earlier... 

The reason we broke up wasn't because we don't like each other (quite the contrary! I still keep in touch) but because we both know each other well enough to know that we just wouldn't want to do long distance. 

I feel...i dunno, like my heart is eating itself alive? Really shitty I guess. Look, my life is good. I get good grades, I have lots of friends, I play sports and people here I think like me too! I understand that I'm coming off as a massive jackass to some of you, probably. ""Oh, woe is me! I amicably broke up with my girlfriend!"" 

Maybe I don't even have the right to feel bad but genuinely I feel absolutely disgusting. I fucking miss her. It's just... I  feel sorta empty I guess. Like I lost part of my life. Reason I'm even telling you guys this is because while I tend to keep most of my real life to myself, this is just something that is too much for me to bottle up I think. I dunno.

Ah well, I'm young. Probably just being a over reacting asshole, who probably doesn't have the right to feel this bad, and I'm really sorry if this post comes off as me being a total asshole. Im sorry. I didn't mean to if it came off that way. 

Oh, and I stubbed my toe this morning, so that's just peachy. Hope you all had a good week though!","Sorry to hear 'bout the breakup, dude.

I know how you feel, I too broke up with my girlfriend (of 1 year) about 2 months ago, albeit for different reasons that I don't really want to explain ...

You're totally not coming off as being an asshole, emotions like that are completely normal in a situation like this.

Best advice I can give you: Keep your chin up, don't let your problems consume you and, the most important thing, to quote our dear late great Monty Oum: ''Keep moving forward''. Things begin and they end eventually, nothing is forever. You're probably gonna need some time to get over the initial flood of emotions, but once you do, you'll notice that you will feel great and fresh to start something completely new!

And of course never forget the most important thing: Be yourself, always!

Don't worry, you're gonna make it, I know it!",2,3.0,2.0,"<speaker> Gonna be real here...worst week of my life, haha. 

Gonna keep it relatively short because I don't want to bother anyone (hypocritical because I'm making the post to begin with), but I just broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years like...a few days ago. 

We had known she was moving to the states for months now, but we tried to pretend it wasn't happening. In retrospect, maybe should have broke it off earlier... 

The reason we broke up wasn't because we don't like each other (quite the contrary! I still keep in touch) but because we both know each other well enough to know that we just wouldn't want to do long distance. 

I feel...i dunno, like my heart is eating itself alive? Really shitty I guess. Look, my life is good. I get good grades, I have lots of friends, I play sports and people here I think like me too! I understand that I'm coming off as a massive jackass to some of you, probably. ""Oh, woe is me! I amicably broke up with my girlfriend!"" 

Maybe I don't even have the right to feel bad but genuinely I feel absolutely disgusting. I fucking miss her. It's just... I  feel sorta empty I guess. Like I lost part of my life. Reason I'm even telling you guys this is because while I tend to keep most of my real life to myself, this is just something that is too much for me to bottle up I think. I dunno.

Ah well, I'm young. Probably just being a over reacting asshole, who probably doesn't have the right to feel this bad, and I'm really sorry if this post comes off as me being a total asshole. Im sorry. I didn't mean to if it came off that way. 

Oh, and I stubbed my toe this morning, so that's just peachy. Hope you all had a good week though! </speaker> <listener> Sorry to hear 'bout the breakup, dude.

I’ve seen him intubated post-surgery before, it sucks, but he’s never had pneumonia out of nowhere. Agonizing. I have a lot of family support, help with childcare, and ability to take work leave but I am still terrified.

33,1.0,"Thank you. That has really helped me. I stopped eating and couldn't function.  I lost 20 lb within a couple of weeks. I was and still am a mess. The guy I had been seeing for 7 months never spoke to me again after I told him making me feel even worse. I feel dirty and not sure what's going to happen.  It is high risk. I had to go to a doctor out of town who would treat me with no insurance as the first doc told me all I needed but his hands was tied because I have no insurance.

  For me this was the straw that broke me.  I've had a terrible few years. My husband came out to be cheating,  on singles websites to meet other women. He left me and the kids. We ended up homeless as he left us with nothing. I hit rock bottom and was suicidal but somehow pushed through,  went back to college and started to put my life back together.  It was worse because I'd just lost my mum. I moved halfway across the world to be with my family.  Just clothes in suitcases.  No possessions in the world.i've been here almost a year and had met someone as soon as I moved. I was finally happy and felt like I could do this. I'd met an  amazing man and I have started a business.  Still have nothing but rebuilding.finally I could breathe and was happy for the first time in along time.  Then this man dumps me by text and never spoke to me again when I thought we was going to be together forever (I know that's stupid but I just thought it was my time to be loved and he'd come into my life for a reason) then that week I went to the health department as i had signs and find out I have this. It's been the topping to make me snap. I feel like I'm losing it. The doc has me on all sorts to get my immune system to build up to fight this and to deal with my mind and sleeping to stop me crying all the time and making it worse. She even hugs me and has cried with me.

2 years ago I had every test under the sun and a pap test  because of my husband cheating and all was clear and healthy so no signs of anything at all. 

This doc is even trying to educate me on men cause I'm to trusting and it seems not very wise. What do i know about dating today. I was married in my teens for 20 years.

What you shared really has helped.  Thank you

","I’m sorry to hear about everything you went through and your recent breakup. One thing I got from your story was at one point life for you was at its worst but it got better and you overcame something you thought you never would and that’s exactly what’s going to happen this time around. Life is one hell of a roller coaster but as humans we adapt and persevere!

The guy that left you over this is an asshole and could be a blessing in disguise. If he left you over something he more than likely caused then god knows what else he would have left you for. He clearly didn’t love you and that’s not someone you want in your life anyway. You want someone that loves you unconditionally and that is understanding and this guy was clearly selfish and was maybe looking for an out anyway. You will meet someone way better I promise you.

Things may suck right now but there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Like seriously my best friend being high risk which I think you are too if I remember correctly and not showing signs of HPV in 10 years is a true testament that the body really does pass the virus.

Maybe take that 20 pounds you lost and use it as a head start in the gym and start to get into the best shape you’ve ever been in your life and it will help you mentally too. I’d also write down all of the positives in your life and your future goals and focus on that because simply focusing on the negatives is so toxic and life is wayyyyyy too short.

I am really sorry, OP, but honestly, I'm kind of...not happy for you, but I've seen enough relationships where a partner gets shitty and then strings along the other person for months (or years): ""If you just do X, then we can stay together"" ""If you can chill out about Y, we can stay together"", and that other person twists themselves up trying to do X or Y and just feels miserable.

I'm glad that he's at least making a clean break here and not stringing you along. I would guess that's cold comfort at best, but at least you can work on healing your heart instead of trying to contort yourself to make something work that sounds pretty unworkable (to judge by his behavior).

I am really sorry, OP, but honestly, I'm kind of...not happy for you, but I've seen enough relationships where a partner gets shitty and then strings along the other person for months (or years): ""If you just do X, then we can stay together"" ""If you can chill out about Y, we can stay together"", and that other person twists themselves up trying to do X or Y and just feels miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad that he's at least making a clean break here and not stringing you along. I would guess that's cold comfort at best, but at least you can work on healing your heart instead of trying to contort yourself to make something work that sounds pretty unworkable (to judge by his behavior).

Im 60k in debt and cant afford to go to school again, and my parents loathe me. I think Im going to kill myself. Im fucking tired of people telling me life is worth living. I just wanna fucking die. Im a usless sack shit, and every day Im alive is fucking torture. I crave death. 

edit: thanks so much for all the support everyone. I was real drunk when I posted that, and I was really surprised to see so many responses when I woke up. Things have been real tough this year, and I'm having a hard time just getting by. Getting to interact with y'all has been one of the few things that has kept me crawling out of bed each morning. Thank you so much for that. </speaker> <listener> Find one reason to smile.  Every victory is a victory, no matter how small.  It sounds like you're surrounded with shitty people.  You need to find people who will support you.  Real friends (and family) would never tear you down.

Remember that you're valuable.  You're not worthless, and you're not a sack of shit.  You are someone who has worked hard and faced all of lifes tests until now.  You can make it through this.

I don't know you, personally, but I enjoy your input here.  I'm very sorry that you're going through this dark time, but I really hope you find the strength to keep going.  Reach out to a professional, they can point you in all the right directions to solve any problem that they can't help you with personally (debt).

Find happiness, indulge in it.  A sunrise once gave me strength.  I'd forgotten what happiness felt like.  That was 5 years ago.

It's still a battle to this day, but a fresh muffin, an old song, coffee and a cigarette, these are the things that keep me going.  The rest is just noise.  Don't pay any attention to it.

You are loved. </listener>"
721,3.0,"This is a non-gaming rant with a lot of whining. I will delete this if it's too off-topic.

My life is a bit of a mess recently and I feel like I will blow up. I will try to keep unnecessary details out.

About a month ago, after a long period of drolling over animations and models, I saw on internet and games, I decided I would like to get into 3d modeling, preferably on a professional level. And so I started to watch tutorials, learn etc. After a long period of feeling basically numb, having a goal made me feel... positive I guess. (I have a really hard time describing my feelings or thoughts). 
Everything was fine for a while, I was unemployed, but I had some money I saved while I worked. I spent my time working in blender, doing basic stuff.

Recently, I found a job. The problem is, even though I work in a field for which I have my masters, I am not happy or satisfied. There are few reasons for that:

- Main problem: I don't like the field I went in school for (thank god education is free in my country so I don't have to pay too much for my incapability in deciding what I want to do for the rest of my life)

- my boss is not very capable (this is the most polite word I could think of) and the result is that most workers are not happy because of the constant strain. That, of course, leads to backstabbing between workers. You can imagine how nice it is to work in that kind of environment.

- there are unpaid overtimes and basically, if you get a shit load of assignments, you are not going home until you are done. Yesterday I didn't even had lunchtime and still went home 40 minutes after my shift was over.

- since there is a slight chance to stay after a 3 months period, I'm doing all I can to read books and learn about my job but that leaves me little to no time to learn blender (I even cut my gaming time to maybe twice a week for an hour or two. I stopped writing which sucks. I really wanted to write the sequel to my fanfic.

Basically, when I think about it, I'm not quitting my job because of my parents. They are happy and hopeful I will get a better position in the company. They don't know about my little wish about 3d modeling and I don't think they would be very supportive of that since they know nothing about it. And to be fair, what are the chances of me succeeding?  Very little. I'm not saying I want them to finance me while I chase something only I can see, just maybe change my job where there are better work hours or something. It's funny, I'm a  grown up and still afraid what my mom and dad will say, instead of living my own life. I feel like this whole 3d modeling stuff is sliding from my hands.

I don't know why I'm writing this tbh. I guess I need to vent before I go crazy. Keeping things inside for too long is never good, but I can't help myself. Because I feel like I'm a weak person you know? Like I can't deal with my own shit so I have to whine. Or maybe I'm just making excuses. I don't know anymore. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors or something. I should sleep more.

","Don't be sorry. Venting isn't a bad thing, and I didn't consider your comment ""whining"" in any way whatsoever.

My personal opinion, don't quit on it just yet. You wouldn't want the time you put into this to be a waste. If it's possible, look into different business that need 3D modelers. When you find a more respectable business that allows you free time, inform your boss about what went wrong and move on. I may be naive about what the real world can be and how hard it must be to find another business, but it's all I can recommend. I wish you luck in future endeavors.

She blames her insecurities so definitely right there. This is some sound advice and I appreciate it.

I blame myself for the way this week unfolded and I just got a new job so that has added a lot of extra stress because it isnt a day job I got put on with a tv show and they are very sporadic with their dates and times they need which makes it hard to plan out times we can hang out and she tells me she thinks shes distracting me which is quite the opposite. I want to do it more because the pay is actually quite nice and in just I can use that to go on fun trips and dates with her. Hell we just bought tickets to go to denver in January. I've never felt this way about anyone even the people that are closest to me. Fuck the month prior to meeting this girl I was nearly dead broke and had no motivation to do anything. I was actively pursuing my career but not to the extent that i am now because i have this backing force constantly telling me that this is gonna make life so much better if you stick with it.","Make sure you focus on your sense of self. Be calm and nurturing to yourself. I can’t tell you how amazing therapy was in that when my behavior changed, so did others around me.

But probably goofed again by telling her that I can only love her as much as she'll let me. 

She blames her insecurities so definitely right there. This is some sound advice and I appreciate it. I think therapy is for everyone and after seeing a therapist weekly for almost a year after a lot of suicidal thoughts and visions. But god this weekend is gonna suck if I cant talk to her. I blame myself for the way this week unfolded and I just got a new job so that has added a lot of extra stress because it isnt a day job I got put on with a tv show and they are very sporadic with their dates and times they need which makes it hard to plan out times we can hang out and she tells me she thinks shes distracting me which is quite the opposite. I want to do it more because the pay is actually quite nice and in just I can use that to go on fun trips and dates with her. Hell we just bought tickets to go to denver in January. I've never felt this way about anyone even the people that are closest to me. Fuck the month prior to meeting this girl I was nearly dead broke and had no motivation to do anything. I was actively pursuing my career but not to the extent that i am now because i have this backing force constantly telling me that this is gonna make life so much better if you stick with it. </speaker> <listener> Make sure you focus on your sense of self. Be calm and nurturing to yourself. I can’t tell you how amazing therapy was in that when my behavior changed, so did others around me.

503,1.5,"My husband and I have just been informed that we need to find a new home for our three cats or a new living situation ASAP because of my husband’s grandfather who was recently diagnosed with melanoma cancer of the liver, kidneys, and lungs. Mind you this was just a couple weeks after we were not even told (but expected) to be the main caretakers of said grandfather (I work from home, so I’m guessing that’s why?). My husband is of course devastated by the news of the cancer, even if doctors are optimistic (cancer is lost never a good word to hear).

After sending over an article from the American Cancer society that unless he is allergic there shouldn’t be an issue— we get a follow up that it’s actually because the cats will hurt him emotionally because he apparently really hates them. 🙃 We’ve talked to him about the cats before and he just asked that we keep them off of the table and out of his room, and we’ve done a pretty great job at that. He’s never said that he hates them and wants them out, but all of the sudden shit is changing now AFTER his aunt was visiting (and she actually hates cats).

Sooooooo yeah.

627,1.5,"So, last week was an absolutely horrible week, and I'm finding myself sliding into a deep depression.

So much shit, and I'm trying to handle it all, and I don't know when I'm gonna finally snap. So, Brutal honesty time, and hopefully I can get some advice that will be useful in getting me out of this funk.

Tuesday of last week my dog, Colt, had a seizure and fell in the pool. We took him to the vet to get checked out, and found out he had cancer that had spread throughout his body, and a tumor in his brain was causing a nystagmus impacting his balance and he was having trouble standing.

I'm sitting on nearly six figures in credit card debt from my divorce, one year into a three-year plan to repay all of it, and depite progress, I just feel smothered. I know it's just some short-term misery for long-term happiness, but fuck, I just want to get this whole ordeal over with. 

Adding on, I hate my living situation - currently living with my GF and her family, and it is truly miserable for me. I don't think anybody in her family understands me, my work, my thought process, or really even logic in general. I get weird looks for working on proofs of concept for a startup after I come home from work, and really all I want to do is move out. Adding on, I moved from GA to be out here just over a year ago, and I really don't have ny friends here, primarily because of how much I'm working. 

As it is, I love what I do for work (software product management) but I really hate my place of employment, and living in Southern California. The company I work for provides software to sleazy debt settlement companies, and the shit I see makes me feel like I need a shower constantly. I've been job searching in Austin (combination of no state income taxes, lower cost of living, and friends), but am constantly hammered by work being too busy for me to take the time to adequately prepare for a phone interview, and the fact I'm not local stars me out behind the 8-ball. 

Getting back on the startup - I've been building out a proof of concept, and I'm getting to the point where I'm in over my head technically.

I'm absolutely tired of being strung along, and I just don't know how to address it - I've been persistent, and working towards the goal as much as possible without any help, but I'm running out of what I'm capable of doing to get things launched by myself.

I experienced male PPD after the birth of my daughter. 

I looked forward to her birth so much and then was so confused because I didn't feel any of the things I was supposed to. I didn't feel any of this overwhelming love everyone said I would feel. I just felt nothing for her. I remember just looking at her wondering why I wasn't enamoured with her like I was ""supposed"" to be. After a couple of weeks (after going back to work), this indifference turned into something I could only describe as hate and resentment. Every time I had to do something for her, I felt annoyed by it. Every time my wife asked for something, I also felt annoyed. I was always annoyed. I didn't enjoy things I used to enjoy, like my favorite video game &amp; watching my hockey team play. I just hated being alive all of a sudden. 

Every time my daughter cried, I found myself wishing I could hit command+z on her existence. She was a difficult baby - one of those ones who just cried and cried and cried. I was so sleep deprived that sometimes, my vision was blurry. I'd fight with my wife over little things and then miss my old life because we were that couple who never fought before this. I felt like I was trapped in this middle class prison - as soon as I got home from work, my wife has handing her straight to me so she could nap. Which I understand. But I found myself purposely trying to get held up on the way home to avoid having to go home because it felt like this middle class prison I was going home to - a difficult demanding baby I felt nothing for and only cared for because I ""had"" to and an exhausted wife who was irritable. 

My wife would take pictures and coo over her and talk about how much her life felt complete now we had a little family but I was just miserable and couldn't put my finger on why. People would talk about how it must be 'so awesome' to be a new dad but all I could think was 'actually, it fucking sucks'. I feel like if the house burned down, my reaction would have been ""oh, I better get the baby so people don't think I'm an asshole"" and secretly hoping I burned down with the house, while my wife's reaction would have been to save her no matter the risk to herself. 

But I couldn't work out why I felt the way I did, I knew I wasn't ""supposed"" to, which made me feel this crushing guilt which just made it even worse. I felt like shit because I wasn't enjoying being a dad and because I literally would have hit command+z and ""undone"" her if given the chance. I can't express how much reading some of the comments in the other post would have gotten to me and made me feel worse. Being called selfish for feelings I couldn't help but just *did* would have really taken a toll on me. I wasn't TRYING to be selfish, I just felt trapped and miserable. Screaming things like ""selfish"" ""grow up"" ""manbaby"" ""suck it up"" at someone who might well be depressed is not going to help them one little bit. 

I was at the doctor getting a flu shot when he asked how I was. I took a few seconds too long before giving the ""required"" and ""expected"" answer of how amazing it was. He wasn't fooled. He made me talk and immediately referred me to a therapist for PPD. With the help of medication and therapy, I started to feel better. It wasn't an instant thing, it did take some time. But I felt so much better just knowing that it wasn't ""my fault"" that I felt the way I did and that there was a name for it and it is something that affects a lot of other men as well. 

Four years later - I do very much love my daughter. She's my little buddy. It helped a bit when she got older and did more than sleep/poop/cry/eat, but the main thing that enabled me to bond with her and stop feeling either ""indifference"" or ""hate"" depending on how difficult she was at that moment was getting the help I needed to get my brain chemistry back in sync. Once I got the supportive help I needed, things improved. I've decided we are one and done because I fear having PPD again so much (disappoints my wife but she understands and also has the reason of not wanting to ""push our luck"" since we have a healthy kiddo and we are now at the age of higher risk for problems), but I'm glad I got through it. 

Being a dick to people who express these thoughts is not going to help them if they have PPD. In fact, you might make it worse  for them by driving home even more how they are not feeling the ""right"" things to feel. 

","Wow, I was in your exact same shoes when my son was born. I was so excited while my wife was pregnant and then he came and I felt nothing. He was not an easy baby, we were in the hospital with a UTI at a month old and he was in and out of the doctors with allergies and reflux symptoms. All I saw him as was a big medical bill and now I look back and resent myself for it.

Reporting the landlord isn't an option, because he'll try to raise rent or sell the place and we'll literally end up homeless. The clutter is 100% our responsibility and something I've been working on (and struggling to get my husband on board with decluttering.) I don't know how to help the other mess though. I can't wash dishes when the plumbing doesn't work correctly for example. Sorry to hijack your post, but I literally sat in my house crying today over this situation so your post was pretty timely. Any advice (besides reporting my landlord or moving) is welcome.","I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this! For dishes, I would suggest disposable plates/cutlery for now like Royal Chinet. For meals, ideally go for those that don’t require a lot of cooking/pans. And I’d also suggest supplementing your current food shopping with social services like a food bank or food stamps if you don’t already do so. Do you have running water and drainage working properly anywhere in the apartment? If so, you can probably make a dent in some of the dishes (you can use a bucket or big pot to wash dishes, then dump the water.) I love camping so I’m used to washing dishes in limited water/no sink, but it requires being strategic about using dishes and implements.

I think mid/long term, you need to budget and plan to get out of there and/or look into socially assisted or cooperative housing if it’s available and if market priced housing is unaffordable. An emergency fund is a good idea so you can tell a landlord like this where to go next time or get small repairs done yourself. Maybe r/personalfinance might be helpful for this. Short term, decluttering by selling stuff can be an opportunity to build the housing fund, and you just have to keep chipping away where you can. Less stuff is far cheaper to move, too.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> Thanks for sharing. I'm struggling with some of this too. The previous post resonated with me too which made me sad.

272,1.0,"He always said he would rather have me than children, but even though his stance on children has flip flopped over the years, I knew deep down he wanted them. I worried that years from now he would regret it and would grow to resent me. Before the counter argument of how I can grow to resent him now, I was able to conscientiously make the decision. If we never had children, it wouldn’t be 100% his choice, he would have just compromised his position and accepted it. 

My doctor didn’t think I could get pregnant, so we haven’t been careful in years. I’m not a believer in “gods will/plan”, but it happened against the odds, and I knew husband’s stance, so I decided he would be worth going through with this.

In black and white on paper, there’s no reason for us to not have a baby. Our house is big enough and we have some money in savings. It was purely my personal preference and my complete and utter lack of interest in having/dealing with babies or children for the last 28 years. The timing couldn’t possibly be worse, we found out the night before I started a new job with the state, and he was just a few months shy of starting his clinical rotations for PA school. But the cringy adage that is constantly thrown at me is, “There’s never really a good time to have children, haha you’ll be ok.”

I know I’m rambling to no one in particular, but it beats writing everything out in an inanimate object like a journal where I’m trapped with only my perspective.

TLDR; I honestly believed I could accept and adapt to having a baby in my great life, in spite of my CF mindset, and the fact that I can’t adjust 9 months and 6 weeks later is utterly destroying me and no one can comprehend why.


","Besides therapy, are you taking care of yourself? Do you have dates with your husband? Time to yourself? Do you have time for personal care whether it is haircare, skin care, make up, exercising, personal hobbies?

Do you have a therapist that is CF-friendly, meaning that he doesn't see your turmoil as ""just PPD, you'll be fine""? Someone who can help you with the choice you made that doesn't suit you at all?

Can you at least talk about your feelings to your husband? He knew from the beginning that you didn't want kids. Is he able to be understand?

Is leaving him with sole custody of the child an option you would consider? What would hurt more : being an unwilling mother and staying with him or leaving him with all the stigma that it means but being free?
