884,2.0,I'm in my last year of Uni &amp; Working to support myself &amp; Commuting home 2-3 times per week to help with some family issues &amp; trying to maintain a minimal social life so I don't feel alone throughout this burnout (ie. the only hanging out rn is while studying),"I ran on a schedule like that my last semester of university. Sometimes it's necessary, but try to cut out some of those responsibilities if you can. Maybe only 1 time a week to family? It is your last year so there's not much longer, you'll get through this!

Start eating every 2-3 hours. I kept a bunch of protien bars in my bag and set a timer to remind me to eat one. I wasn't hungry because of the stress, but your body is hungry because it needs fuel to do all these stressful things. Try and eat as healthy as possible.

I get having sleep problems too, I had the same thing when I was in your situation. Taking melatonin before bed helped me a lot. But also, I had a timer set and forced myself to get in bed and try to sleep for at least 4 hours a night.

Good luck man, it sounds like a rough time. But this too shall pass! I wouldn't be hard on yourself until you can catch a break.",2,2.0,2.0,"<speaker> I'm in my last year of Uni &amp; Working to support myself &amp; Commuting home 2-3 times per week to help with some family issues &amp; trying to maintain a minimal social life so I don't feel alone throughout this burnout (ie. the only hanging out rn is while studying) </speaker> <listener> I ran on a schedule like that my last semester of university.

Then i woke up at 2:45am and decided to have a smoke and as soon as i lit my smoke our other cat meowed and cried and it sounded so horrible so i ran back in and she was standing by our sick cat crying.

233,1.0,"I would agree with this. I think That Dragon Cancer is a great example that I will happily trot out as 'using games as a medium to tell an emotive and impactful story', it's... not really a story I want to experience. 

Which is funny, because I should be the ideal target audience for this game. I'm a huge fan of single player, narratively strong stuff that includes everything from experimental interactive fiction to point and click adventure games. My mom got cancer five years ago, and one of my closest uncles died from cancer as well. 

But that's *exactly* why I don't want to go near the game. At the end of the day, effective as it was, I'm not getting anything out of it except a general sense of depression and sadness. For me – and, I suspect, for a lot of other people as well – games are very much escapism and a way to experience things I can't in real life. I don't know a lot of people who want to experience a kid dying from cancer, though. 

I'd say a good counterexample would be something like, say, Among the Sleep. It's a first person survival adventure game, you play as a child, you explore a story that's frankly *pretty fucking dark*, and that did a TON better than That Dragon Cancer. There was also a solid payoff at the end, narratively, for the player.

i think the game should've been  marketed a bit more cleverly, so that the real theme and impact is hidden from the player (ala, Doki Doki Literature Club).

222,1.5,"Guys, you always give a great emotional help and I really need it right now.

My situation: 

- moved out of my parents, dropped out of university. Living on my own, in a city where I know just my colleagues from work that I found

- I have been scouted by a modelling agency and now after about 2-3 months, they are sending me to China for 3 months. (from march to may)

- now, I am still skinny motherfucker but gained some weight and strength and a little bit of fat. they want me to cut it down so I look more shredded. And that's what makes me a bit depressed/anxious.

I am about 5'11"" and just 155 lbs. Now I have to cut and will become even skinnier. But yeah, I have to accept that, it's a part of the job. But still, it bugs me. I will be there for 3 months and I think there won't be any consistent gym access for consistent routine and I won't be really able to cut/bulk there. I am afraid that I will lose all my muscle and all my hard work will go to shit. 

And now, I don't even know how to approach that weight loss I need to do. Should I just cut for these 2 months prior? Or do a recomp? :( 

I don't even know what I am asking or what I want to hear.

","It sounds like you should talk to the modelling agency a bit more.

My situation: 

- moved out of my parents, dropped out of university. Living on my own, in a city where I know just my colleagues from work that I found

- I have been scouted by a modelling agency and now after about 2-3 months, they are sending me to China for 3 months. (from march to may)

- now, I am still skinny motherfucker but gained some weight and strength and a little bit of fat. they want me to cut it down so I look more shredded. And that's what makes me a bit depressed/anxious.

I am about 5'11"" and just 155 lbs. Now I have to cut and will become even skinnier. But yeah, I have to accept that, it's a part of the job. But still, it bugs me. I will be there for 3 months and I think there won't be any consistent gym access for consistent routine and I won't be really able to cut/bulk there. I am afraid that I will lose all my muscle and all my hard work will go to shit. 

And now, I don't even know how to approach that weight loss I need to do. Should I just cut for these 2 months prior? Or do a recomp? :( 

I don't even know what I am asking or what I want to hear.

147,3.0,"So what *is* the answer?

I'm married to a woman with depression.  We just celebrated our ten year anniversary.  I've tried everything.  I've tried the rational approach, which I understand now why it might not be helpful.  I've tried the empathetic ""Want to talk?  If not, that's OK - I'm still here for you"" approach and just sitting there with her and being with her, letting her know I love her and I'm sorry for what she's going through.  She's tried therapy and prescriptions.  We've tried couple's therapy together.  We've tried spending more time alone together to focus on us.  We've tried spending more time with other people in order to try to spend *less* time alone and run from our problems.  She's tried going back to school in order to get her degree and increase her self-worth (she's always been insecure about not having a degree).  I've tried finally relenting and just saying ""Yes"" to everything she wants - we bought a new house in a new area like she wanted, bought her the car she always wanted, replaced literally all of our furniture, etc.

And yet it's only gotten worse.  I'm at my emotional breaking point.  Nothing's ever enough.  No treatment or potential solution has helped.  I'm a flawed human being, but I'll do my absolute best to be as compassionate, available and patient as I possibly can be, while still trying to take time for myself - but the moment I take a mis-step (didn't read her mind to see what she wanted in that moment, said or did something dumb, can't comply with some demand of hers, etc.), it's a monumental explosion.  I ""never listen,"" ""never show compassion.""  She ""shouldn't have to tell me what she needs, because [I] should just know.""

I'm the punching bag for all her negative emotions and factors.  All the anger and frustration she can't take out on every else - I get it instead.

I love this woman.  We just celebrated our ten year anniversary.  There's nothing more I want in the world than for her to just be happy and content.  But every dissatisfaction in her life somehow ends up falling on my shoulders, and every inadequacy of mine ends up being a reason for her to break down crying and get upset with me for not being there enough for her and being a better husband.

Wtf is the answer, man.  How do you help someone that's going through this, when their first instinct is to make you the enemy?  I feel like I'm trying to save a person drowning in the ocean, and every time I try to help them put the life preserver on, they grab it and start beating me in the face with it.  I've lost all optimism at this point.  I'm defeated.  Honestly, *I'm* depressed now.

I don't actually expect any answers really.  I'm mainly typing this out as catharsis.  I can't talk to our friends or my family about it, because it doesn't seem fair to her.","Hey.  First of all, I want to say you are a good person. A strong and valiant man to do everything you can to help improve the situation.  Its easy to see how much you love this woman.  And, having these feelings is not wrong.  Its not bad.  You need to take care of yourself too.

I have severe manic depression.  I know I am a burden on my significant other - but one thing is pretty common.  Deep depression really doesn't manifest itself like this.  There are definitely some other issues going on with her. Anger issues. Sure she probably has depression too - but when you are depressed, you barely have energy to do anything, let alone pick fights. You withdrawal.  You become distant. that is my burden with my Significant other.  I know I push here away because its too taxing to be THAT person for them, especially when you have to maintain at a job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would suggest you go to counseling on your own. Without her. You need some clarity and someone outside of the relationship to really be able to help you see what is going on.  Alone, you will open up more and give a more truthful picture of what exactly is going on.

402,2.0,"Literally me. Ive only been getting actual treatment maybe a year, and ive gotten a few good things out of it. 1 or 2 new coping skills and some much needed ""what am i gonna do with my life"" help. But the meds do literally nothing, not even a smidgen of a side effect. I wish i had some helpful advice but im in the same sinking ship unfortunately

I cant drive, legally atleast.

I have been suffering from depression for a while and I don't always make the best decisions when I am.  To this end, I’ve deactivated my dating profiles and have decided to focus on my health.

I feel like I should delete my reddit account.  I have deleted all my posts but for now I'm just going to take a break from reddit as a whole and if I still feel that way when I come back, I will delete then.

I wish you all well.  And kinda, so long and thanks for all the fish!

Edit: you guys are so great!!! </speaker> <listener> No. Just no on this whole damn post. 

I'm sorry about what happened, I'm sorry you're hurting. Take a breather if you need to, but if you gain something by interacting with this community then I think walking away from it is self-punishing. On a personal note I wouldn't like it one bit, anc clearly I'm not alone in feeling this way.

Whatever you do is your choice of course, but for now, change that flair. That is NOT who you are and it makes me sad to see it next to your u-name.  

I'm someone who also has trouble reaching out to people so I understand the struggle, but if you ever want to chat my door is open. It would be great to chat with you if you're ever up for it. 

Hugs, lady 💜 </listener>"

Bless your heart!! *(The worried version, not the backhanded one) * I want you to know that it’s completely fine if you’re not up for it. 

Your job is absolutely not worth your mental health and joy for life. You are allowed to take care of yourself. If it becomes necessary for you to walk away for a bit, then you need to do that. Maybe you could think of it as a way of taking better care of your lil boss in the long run. If you’re basically the one responsible for kids’ major early learning (and you really want them to not be little assholes and be decent humans later on) then you need to be in good health mentally, physically, and emotionally. Cause we both know that some days end up being just a fucking bad day.  Think of the lil boss as a teacup, empty and ready to be filled with wonderful things; you’re the pot with the skills and knowledge and love to fill them with decent human skills. If you don’t take time to refill yourself and make sure you’re ok, you’re eventually gonna be empty and have nothing left to give. 

So, I suggest taking some time to take care of yourself. Find a therapist or counselor to speak with. Start a journal. Try yoga. Take some time and get away for a long weekend to recharge. And if you’re as close to the boss’ mom as I was lucky enough to be to mine, talk to her about it! Tell her you might need some time off or maybe some flexibility if possible as you need. A 2 year old and a newborn sounds insane enough. 

If you ever need to talk at or with someone, feel free to PM me.

You're allowed to grieve. You're allowed to... be working on fixing yourself, rather than ""changing the world"". You're allowed to have shitty days. Nobody can take any of those from you.

269,1.0,"Okay, so I am not trying to take over this thread or anything, but I really feel the need to voice my experience as well. I’m a private person and would rather not even talk about it at all, but I think it’s important.

OP, I have the exact same problem. Last fall quarter (2017), my brother passed away. It was completely unexpected, and it happened in the middle of the quarter. I had to fly home even, and then I didn't get back to this state (I'm an out of state student) until the middle of November. Everyone, my academic advisors, the counselling center, told me the withdrawal people would not reject my application for the withdrawal.

Well they did. I tried to appeal, and the same woman who denied it in the first place wouldn't even give it to the wider panel, because I didn't introduce anything new for them to review. I provided a death certificate, everything. What else did they need, a picture of my crying that whole week? It was incredibly degrading, insulting, and upsetting (esp given the amount of money I pay to attend this school). At a time in my life when I was trying to be normal again, I just couldn't pursue the argument with them anymore. Impressively, they managed to make me hate life even more. So I guess they’ve accomplished something.

I've been looking into talking with the Ombudsman, so maybe you can try the same. Sorry, not trying to cause a pity party or take over your thread. But just so you know, I can completely understand where you are coming from. I know people have gotten hardship withdrawals from seasonal depression. I had a life-changing, completely unexpected, horrible nightmare happen in my life mid-quarter, and they still couldn't be bothered to send me anything (and by ""they"" I really just mean this one woman) other than robotic jargon. Essentially, they failed to recognize me as a human and didn’t even provide me with any contact info other than her email.

When I tried to ask for a human response as to why they were rejecting me, I got a runaround of basically pre-written guideline expectations. From what I gather (because they make nothing clear), and my advisor gathers, it is because my brother died before the 14th of November, and therefore I had time to withdraw of my own volition before the drop deadline. So, they reject me because of that. Literally, no one else on campus understands why they would make that decision. I wasn’t even in WA state, or even in the right state of mind, to be sorting out school work after my brother just passed away. I had to book a plane ticket and fly five hours, then there was a funeral. And grief. And do I really need to explain it to a normal person? I wasn't even sure if I wanted to drop all of my classes. I ended up getting an incomplete in one, which I finished the next quarter, then badly needed the withdrawal for the other two. I didn't know about the withdrawal deadline. And it's as if upon hearing my brother just died, I would immediately run to the internet and sort through academic deadlines. I didn't even get back to school until basically the day I would have had to drop all my classes anyway, which ultimately wouldn't have worked, because I did still want one class and the withdraw at that point would have been all or nothing I believe. I tried to explain it to them, and again, it was basically the same as talking to a robot.

Again, I might try with the Ombudsman, but it is such an upsetting experience for me to revisit. It brings me back to the worst time in my life, made worse by the school’s administration. I had just gotten back to campus, across the country from my family, and I felt so alone, alienated, and just absolutely horrible. Typing the story out right now, I am getting really upset. I'm not sure if I even should bother again for my own mental health. If you want, feel free to PM me!

I'm so sorry this happened, and it's a serious issue that I'm apparently not alone in. That's exactly how I feel. How was I supposed to sort through jargon when going through all of this? ""Luckily"" I have therapy records of the lack of mental clarity I was in, and I'm hoping this helps with my appeal, but hearing your story really upsets me. This doesn't end with me. You feel free to dm me, too. This is humiliating and infuriating. I know a girl that had a cyst on her ovaries rupture in the summer and we talked about it. She had trouble adjusting to UW that following quarter and told me she was going to lie and say it was still affecting her so she could withdraw. She succeeded. W. T. F.

I'm thinking of going to The Daily. You should also look into legal advice. Expecting students to sort through jargon and dates during times of trauma and illness is ridiculous.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> Okay, so I am not trying to take over this thread or anything, but I really feel the need to voice my experience as well. I’m a private person and would rather not even talk about it at all, but I think it’s important.

OP, I have the exact same problem. Last fall quarter (2017), my brother passed away. It was completely unexpected, and it happened in the middle of the quarter. I had to fly home even, and then I didn't get back to this state (I'm an out of state student) until the middle of November. Everyone, my academic advisors, the counselling center, told me the withdrawal people would not reject my application for the withdrawal.

Well they did. I tried to appeal, and the same woman who denied it in the first place wouldn't even give it to the wider panel, because I didn't introduce anything new for them to review. I provided a death certificate, everything. What else did they need, a picture of my crying that whole week? It was incredibly degrading, insulting, and upsetting (esp given the amount of money I pay to attend this school). At a time in my life when I was trying to be normal again, I just couldn't pursue the argument with them anymore. Impressively, they managed to make me hate life even more. So I guess they’ve accomplished something.

I've been looking into talking with the Ombudsman, so maybe you can try the same. Sorry, not trying to cause a pity party or take over your thread. But just so you know, I can completely understand where you are coming from. I know people have gotten hardship withdrawals from seasonal depression. I had a life-changing, completely unexpected, horrible nightmare happen in my life mid-quarter, and they still couldn't be bothered to send me anything (and by ""they"" I really just mean this one woman) other than robotic jargon. Essentially, they failed to recognize me as a human and didn’t even provide me with any contact info other than her email.

When I tried to ask for a human response as to why they were rejecting me, I got a runaround of basically pre-written guideline expectations. From what I gather (because they make nothing clear), and my advisor gathers, it is because my brother died before the 14th of November, and therefore I had time to withdraw of my own volition before the drop deadline. So, they reject me because of that. Literally, no one else on campus understands why they would make that decision. I wasn’t even in WA state, or even in the right state of mind, to be sorting out school work after my brother just passed away. I had to book a plane ticket and fly five hours, then there was a funeral. And grief. And do I really need to explain it to a normal person? I wasn't even sure if I wanted to drop all of my classes.

You definitely have a lot to be proud of with how you've handled all that shit you were handed and made it into a good life. Anyway, this random stranger on the Internet is impressed haha, and I hope things keep looking up for ya :) </listener>"

15,1.0,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched. I don't want people to think I'm not grateful, but 4 gildings is plenty! Please consider donating to your local Men's shelter instead.

Read this while sitting across from my dad having breakfast. I drove 1400 kms two days ago to surprise mom on her birthday, and am leaving again in a couple of days. Dad had to go to work now, but I plan to spend the weekend glued to his side thanks to your comment. 

Out of all my family, he's always the one I miss the most, the one I've always looked up to since I was a little girl. I just turned 30, but dad's still my hero. The most painful part of my life is feeling like a failure to him, when all I want is for him to be proud of me (I have some mental health issues).

I think he's a little bit like your dad, and I'm a little bit like you. I never really know if I'm bothering him if I ramble at him, and I never am the one to call him (he usually calls me on his way home from work, for 20 minute chats) because I know he works a lot and is always tired, so I don't want to bother him.

But whenever I hug or snuggle up to him, he seems really happy so I'm sure deep down he loves me; he's just a little awkward about expressing it, like I often am. 

Yesterday, my dad's colleague and friend sent a text to my mom saying ""I hear you two just got the greatest present!"" - which means my dad told him I came to surprise them. Thinking about it now after reading your post, it makes me feel very warm and fuzzy. Totally worth the exhaustion I currently feel :D

495,3.5,"Today I went to my significant other's family gathering. I was really nervous, because I've been struggling with severe depression and have been hospitalized repeatedly for it over the past two years.

My significant other doesn't want me to tell his family about it, because they won't understand. But it really wears down on me, pretending that I'm okay. 
Because I'm not okay.

As soon as we got in the car after
Christmas dinner, he told me two remarks I said that were apparently offensive. 

He said that I sounded too critical of him, when I asked him if he really cooked at the table, when he mentioned that he did. At the table, he claimed that he did cook frequently, but I swear that he doesn't. He eats a lot of takeout, and I don't like that. 

His cousin asked him what he got for Christmas, which prompted me to ask if he got money from his uncle again this year. Only a few days ago, he mentioned it was the Christmas gift he most looked forward to. He said that it made him look bad that I asked him that. 

I didn't mean to be overly critical. I was genuinely curious as to if he does cook often and as to what he received this Christmas. I understand that in my culture, we tend to be more blunt and open about money, but I can't change that to accommodate him over night.

I started crying as soon as he grilled me, because I tried really hard to look presentable and act normal and give everyone thoughtful presents. He didn't even ask me how I felt before telling me what he did wrong, though he knew I was nervous to come.

Its been the worst semester ever – in terms of events that have happened to me, and how that has in turn impacted things.

I have been witness to a shooting, my mother died unexpectedly and I was party to several traumatic incidents whilst on placement. None of which I have realised had affected me until all of my grades for my assignments have come through. I know now that my coping strategy of using my course work hasn’t been the healthiest strategy, it has come at the expense of my mental well-being. I struggle to feel well rested or accomplished at the end of a day, with my patience and tolerance being shorter than ever before – all signs of a subconscious that is struggling to comprehend what has happened in such a short time frame. With an increase in anxiety and inability to focus for prolonged periods of time, something which has never happened to me before.

Small things which are easily fixable have been missed which has resulted in me being in a position where on paper I am technically unable to pass the course. All of these minor things I would usually have been fine with, had nothing happened to me. I’ve been struggling for five years to get in the position where I could get this close to passing my degree. After having been through cyfs care growing up and struggling into the transition into independence, its super frustrating to get this close and find that events outside my control have been the final straw to prevent me from passing.

I have been told that in special circumstances things can sometimes be considered, in reading the course materials allowed I came across this:

“*AEG or Aegrotat is a pass granted to a student who for reasons of personal illness,*

*injury or other exceptional circumstances beyond that*

*student’s control, is either absent from, or is able to claim*

*impaired performance in, an item of assessment. An aegrotat*

*pass will only be awarded where the Faculty Leader is satisfied*

*on the basis of the student’s achievement in assessment tasks*

*already completed, that the student would have passed the*

*assessment/course had it not been for the particular personal*

*circumstances involved”*

I guess I should apply for this, only trouble being I’ve not sought assistance from the support services before last week. Our final registration exam is fast approaching on the 20th I need this all sorted out well before so I can have a chance to get my mental state sorted before sitting the registration exam.

I needed to vent, but I guess it remains in the control of the institute – unsure how I feel about that though.

The person who would be making that decision is away until the 12th of November, just adding to the stress as well.","Sorry to hear of your mum's passing and your loss.

When you arrive at surgery place and you start freaking out, tell them you are anxious and they might give you something to calm your nerves before you are fully sedated. 

If you got nauseous from anesthesia after you had your wisdom removed or in general get nauseous easily (even car sick easily), TELL anesthesiologist and they will put a tiny patch behind your ear.

Instead, he decided to ignore your messages for whatever reason—for example, he thought that salvaging the relationship wasn’t possible based on what you said, or he experienced a similar situation like this in the past and didn’t have the confidence that things would turn out any different this time, or perhaps something else. No matter the reason, this is no longer something you have to worry about. You are free to date other people who may be a better match for you. Someone who is willing to give up on a situation (or on you) so easily is probably not someone you want in your life in the long term. </listener>"

I can't go a day without worrying about my future, or school, or my grades...it doesn't help that I have almost no friends in real life - all I have is a small community on Discord that's been like a family to me for a long time now.

That being said, I haven't given up yet. I'm hoping that 
one day I can pull through it all...even it seems really bleak, I know that giving up is just gonna make things worse. I'm certain that sooner or later it'll pay off...eventually. In the meantime, I have Heroes and my Discord community whom I love - the games is one of the few things that can still bring me joy and I'm glad that I'm part of this fun community, despite me not actually doing too much.

What I said about my hardships paying off in the long run can be applied to Heroes too: You may have a really bad time on a banner every now and then, but have faith that one day, you'll pull a bunch of five stars in a single session. Don't give up!

661,2.5,Hi. I think i have depression or something. Its been 4-5 years. Now im out of job and running out of money. I also live alone. How can people like me get help in malaysia. Cant get a diagnosis or see a doctor as im fucking unemployed and dont even have money for lunch. Mental health care is damn expensive.  Im slowly dying and nobody gives a fuck cant even get a job here.,"Hey buddy.

Really sorry to hear about how difficult things have been. You're right in that mental health services can be quite costly, to be fair not just financially, but in terms of time commitments as well. But oftentimes, it can be a great investment for yourself and you can see a positive impact on yourself for years to come. 

There are some good options that you can explore though. Check out government hospitals, if you get a referral letter from a klinik kesihatan or a GP, therapy goes for RM5 per session. Alternatively, try checking out [sols247.org](https://sols247.org) as a good alternative. They have sliding scale therapy fees, so they can adjust according to what you're able to afford as well.

There will always be people out there who care. Just that sometimes, we gotta work a little to find out  where and who they are. Don't give up buddy, hang in there. Keep on ploughing away, you'll get there.",2,3.0,2.0,"<speaker> Hi. I think i have depression or something. Its been 4-5 years. Now im out of job and running out of money. I also live alone.

378,1.0,"3 months of being a useless piece of fat shit. Depression. Ate like shit, content with going home any burying my misery in solitude rather than ever considering a workout of any sort. Who *cares*.

Compounds upon itself, doesn't it? Was extremely fit, but never felt any sort of satisfaction from it. Still hated myself, so just declared ""screw it"" and went about life without concerning physical health anymore.

Now predictable results simply had me fat, as unappealing physically as I am emotionally, and furthering my trash of a person on the path to worthlessness.

A month ago I saw where this was headed. It's been 30 days since I began daily workouts yet again. Convincing myself I could come back. I was working towards **something.**

I wasn't. I'm still shit. I'm still pathetic. I still fucking hate myself, and the funny thing is... it wouldn't matter even if I HAD miraculously made a difference in my appearance, self worth wouldn't change a damn bit.

234,1.0,"I would agree with this. I think That Dragon Cancer is a great example that I will happily trot out as 'using games as a medium to tell an emotive and impactful story', it's... not really a story I want to experience. 

Which is funny, because I should be the ideal target audience for this game. I'm a huge fan of single player, narratively strong stuff that includes everything from experimental interactive fiction to point and click adventure games. My mom got cancer five years ago, and one of my closest uncles died from cancer as well. 

But that's *exactly* why I don't want to go near the game. At the end of the day, effective as it was, I'm not getting anything out of it except a general sense of depression and sadness. For me – and, I suspect, for a lot of other people as well – games are very much escapism and a way to experience things I can't in real life. I don't know a lot of people who want to experience a kid dying from cancer, though. 

I'd say a good counterexample would be something like, say, Among the Sleep. It's a first person survival adventure game, you play as a child, you explore a story that's frankly *pretty fucking dark*, and that did a TON better than That Dragon Cancer.

Sadly many of us have already had that experience, or are happy to have not had it. It's not even a complicated feeling that needs to be explained, given 5 seconds anyone of us can understand how shitty of a situation that is, so why sit in that sewer. 

By using allegory of the emotional journey against some other story telling you suddenly have a deep game that will not only glue to the creator's specific situation but many others that follow the same rhythm.

70,1.5,"Okay, so real talk: after graduation, I like can't even really properly adjust to suddenly not having a hard deadline anymore. And procrastination became a super serious issue for me for the longest time. I basically just wasted away doing nothing like the biggest loser ever.

And like, after New Year, I told myself I can't just keep doing this anymore. So I've been working on that. Now my daily routine basically boils down to: send out 10 resumes each day, do 5 leetcode problems, and use the rest of the time learning new stuff. I'm learning CSS and HTML right now so I can learn Javascript later. Someone told me to start a new side project yesterday so I'm gonna get on that too.

But I am really scared because I really have no idea how I am going to explain the gaps. At all. I mean like nobody responds to my applications anyway so I haven't had to explain it and that makes me doubly depressed because the gap is just getting longer every passing day.

So that sums it up, I think. If I sound calm and normal that's only because you can't actually hear my inner voice crying. I'm super sad right now.","HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all pretty easy. I recommend making your own website and putting some projects up there so employers have easy access to see what you’re capable of if they are interested. 

BUT, make your website look nice. Don’t make it using Wordpress or some generic template. Add some cool functionalities. I learned html and css by using codecademy, it was like a 6 hour course or something, took about a day and it was a good crash course. I’m sure there are better ones out there. 

Don’t beat yourself up. I know a ton of people who have been in your situation. It’s not that uncommon for people to take a year off. Find a reason to explain your gap year, but don’t offer too many details. Don’t tell them you’re depressed or stuff like that.

734,1.0,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, about to turn 4. Some policemen showed up at the door to my house, talked to my mom for awhile, and she started screaming and crying. I was confused, since I loved policemen. They're helpful and strong and friendly, right? How could they make my mom cry like that?

They told me the same thing. My father was dead.

I've always wished I could remember anything about his life. I've seen pictures, and I've heard stories about what he was like from the people whose lives he touched, but that never felt like enough. I wanted to remember him in some way personal to me. I was his only child, and everyone tells me how much he loved me, even to this day. That his love could leave that much of a mark on people, but none apparent on me, was something I could never accept easily.

He had gone from his home town in Kouchi prefecture, Japan, to the United States to work at his friend's business. He was a travel agent. Not a glorious or superb position by most measures, though he certainly didn't mistake his work for his life. He was known by the community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man you would trust with your most valuable things. Still, I find it ironic that as I'm preparing to make the same journey he did now that new year's is over, from my grandparents' house back to the city I grew up in, that even as I've been successful in life by any metric, that I could never find whatever part of my soul it was that belonged to him.

Would he have been proud of his daughter? Anyone who has a father would know that the answer is yes, regardless of my material circumstances. But I never had the luxury of hearing this from him. ""Your father would be so proud of you"" stopped feeling good at some point, and began to sting.

I watched Uchouten Kazoku last year. If you're not aware, one of the main themes of the show has to do with the protagonist dealing with his father's death and legacy. Souichirou Shimogamo was a great man. He was respected by his community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man who could save the world. Yasaburou seeks to measure up to him. Yajirou hides his feelings because he lost his completeness. Yaichirou wants to have his own family. Yashirou desires a fun life.

I am these characters. All of them, all parts of me interacting on the screen, finding themselves and helping each other. I had come to terms long ago with the fact that I would never get whatever it was that I was looking for from my father. Uchouten Kazoku showed me something more valuable than that: my father wouldn't even want me to try.

895,3.5,"So I'm fucked off at my father still. I'm actually contemplating borderline disowning the cunt as this stage.

A few of you know a few years back I postponed my application for Pre-Medicine to head back across the country to my home town and put my palliative nursing skills to service in looking after my last remaining grandparent, my Nana because my dad was running himself into the ground trying to be full time carer for himself and my mother who lives with a disability. And his sisters (my cunt aunts and extended family did fuck all to help)

At the time my Nana's prognosis was something like 6 months and so I thought after it had all came to pass I could go back to Melbourne as re-accept my deferred application. This also stops Nana going into hospice which was something that she and everyone else didn't want at the time. Being in a small town the home nursing services are incredibly limited and not really of help.

So I move in, 4 months in, she gets a diagnosis of spontaneously remission in her secondary cancer, (she had metastatic skin cancer, and her chemo/radiation combo gave her secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma), so her prognosis for an extended life is longer in that regard other than the increasing debilitation of her skin cancer.

So the best part of 5 years drag on, my Pre-Med Acceptance is declined. I'm a 24/7 live in nurse across all aspects of care and house keep for Nana so she doesn't have to be in a home. Little time off othe than a couple of chances to get away. No energy or time for a job as well, other than reddit, there wasn't much else to keep me sane. 

One week after the funeral the cunt aunts and my dad ask me to leave the house or start paying rent (bearing in mind i was not paid other than a small government stipened for looking after Nana for ll this time, which in hospice fees alone would have been $130k a year at least).... So they can sell the place asap and get the money. I move into a friends house, buy a car and drive across the country to move here. The house sits empty for 18 months. I get no family member saying thank you for looking after her, but her friends in the community did.

Now, Nana was cremated after the funeral service and it was her wishes to be returned to her home of The Isle of Wight in the UK and be scattered there. Her ashes have been sitting at my aunts until someone goes back to the UK or they mailed her because that's what she wanted.

I get a SKYPE message at 1.50pm my time yesterday from my cunt father that reads in part ""we are going to scatter (most) of your Nan's ashes today at 2pm in the river (of my home town) so she'll be with your Grandad. A small parcel of her ashes is on it's way to the Isle of Wight""...

I get NO prior warning so that I can be there, I get nothing. I spent the better part of 5 years looking after Nana when no one else was willing to, and informing her of her rights across her medical care and ability to make informed decisions in regards to her care instead of just making her or guilting her to  do shit like her fucking kids did... and I don't even get invited to see her final farewell.

When I asked why I or my sister wasn't told sooner, I got told that I couldn't have afforded to go over there anyway... I'm thinking in my mind: You fucking CUNT you were given over $120k in inheritance, you could have flown my sister and i over and back if you wanted us there....

I'm beyond pissed and upset. I know that if the tables were turned it would have been the worlds biggest drama. 

FUCK my father and my family. Fucking histrionic narcissists.

Am I over reacting? Urgh.

qotd: When I'm talking to my online pretties, they make me forget I'm living a fucking disaster of a life.","No, you're not over reacting. I'm a fucking huge advocate for cutting any shitty family members out of your life if it'll make you happier. What's their sudden rush to scatter her ashes anyway? If your aunt has had them since the funeral, why does it have to be done *right now*? 

You did something truly wonderful in giving up your life to look after your nan, I hope you get some comfort in knowing that she probably had the best fucking care she could possibly have had, even if the shitheads she called children didn't appreciate it ♥

28,2.0,"My boyfriend just broke up with me. The day before Valentine’s Day. And I put my dog down Thursday. Kind of numb . I hope it goes away soon. How long did the pain last for you? I know we’re all different but I’m just searching for answers 

UPDATE: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. Man, I never thought I’d have such amazing support. I feel like I grew new skin just reading everyone’s comments and messages. My nausea is subsiding with every motivational comment. Wow thanks Reddit!","Hey. You'll be okay I promise. My best advice is to embrace the tidal wave of pain as soon as possible. Don't try to not feel sad or angry or hurt or whatever. Just let yourself feel exactly how you feel.

My dad once told me you have a certain number of tears for people or things that happen and you won't be able to move on until you've cried that exact amount of tears. Once you've cried the tears, you won't be able to cry about it anymore, even if you want to, and you'll be able to move on and let go.

Cry the tears. Let both events hurt and cry about both at seperate times.

Say tonight when you get home from work or school or whatever you do during the day, at 630pm for example, cry for half an hour about your dog. Then stop at 7pm. Then cook dinner or do something else. At 830 go and cry over the break up for half an hour, then stop and do something fun. Do this every day for as long as it takes.

Do not forget the fun part though. Once you've cried, go and do something that makes you happy or feel good or generally like doing: watch a movie, have a work out, do a hobby ect. This allows you to also begin to feel normal in your life as it is now (changed). 

Don't allow yourself to wallow unless you've scheduled and end time. It will help you to not fall into depression or a depressive state.

You are awesome. Believe it. This is temporary. You will get through this.

If you don't need the money, just turn off your trading app for the next 2 years. I know it's basically impossible, but that's what it'll take for you to see your huge losses turn into huge gains, and to prevent further depression.

He shares custody of his son with his ex-wife, who lives far away, has had children with other men and separated from them as well, and seems to be struggling with a host of mental conditions and possible drug use problems. His worry (if I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt) is that by adding to the confusion, I might unintentionally lead the kid to some bad conclusions about the myriad of other things he experiences around his mother. I dont see it that way, but idk how to approach it with without disrespecting what he sees as a delicate situation.

Sorry to be such a negative Nellie. Your reply is still very uplifting and helpful. :)

Edit: Thank you!! Forgot to say thank you. lol </speaker> <listener> I’m sorry about how difficult things are for you. It sounds like life is showing you it’s time to fight for what you think is right. I am sure that you will rise above all this and soon you’ll be in a place of strength, and a strong person that identifies as female is someone that no one should deny the influence of. With any luck this will work out and you’ll be able to argue that you’re well adjusted and happy and that should be enough of a positive influence for anyone. Right now it might be best to find your own way and have the strength to allow people and their influences back on your own terms. I wish you the best of luck, I know how difficult it can be even just finding a job or using the restroom. Be strong. </listener>"
738,1.5,Once i was sitting in a park with my girlfriend and a cop came and directly asked for money or else he would call our parents. We weren't doing any PDA. Simply sitting on a bench.

Another man got confrontational for no good reason. I asked him to mind his own business and he slapped me on my face.

Chronic pain is life, but I kinda just dealt with it, because fuck being one of those vets that die from opioid addiction, like my dad....let that sink in.

I almost died, arterial tear from the shattered pelvis. I've been kinda wondering if I died on the table. They told everyone that they almost lost me. Whatever. 4lbs of titanium hardware holding all those bones together, and I honestly feel all of it man. My arms are the worse. Nerve damage to hell. It feels like every spot of skin has an ant biting it. Confused damaged regrowing nerves. It all just sucks now. I'm healing, getting stronger and such, but it's not going to be like it was, and it hurts all the time. The pain is enough now that I can't say fuck it, because I literally cannot function.

768,2.5,"I’m in kind of a weird headspace lately. My mom is an addict alcoholic who’s been in and out of recovery for the last 11 years. I’ve been on my own since I was 13 because drugs and men were more important than her kids. She’s had two long stints sober, one three years from 2008-2011 and most recently 2 years and 5 months, and I found out last Saturday that she relapsed. It wasn’t bad this time. She didn’t go on a weeks or months long bender. She didn’t hole herself up in a condemned house and smoke crack and heroin for two weeks. She didn’t get a DUI or wreck her car and leave the scene or try to fight the Asian lady at the Chinese restaurant screaming “Speak fucking Engrish” because she couldn’t understand her, she didn’t take all of her antidepressants and barbiturates with a handle of vodka to kill herself and write DNR on her wrists and ankles, all things she’s *actually* done. 

What happened was that she felt suicidal and asked her psychiatrist for something and he gave her Klonopin, a drug she’s abused and OD’d on more than once, because she said “the walls were crawling and I wanted to die but couldn’t bring myself to kill myself and the Klonopin made it stop.” But it felt too good. She took a half a pill, then a whole, then more than one, and my sister found her last Thursday and took her to detox because she felt herself falling into bad habits. She admitted she made a mistake and never should have taken it, but that she didn’t know what else to do because she was feeling suicidal. 

She has every reason to feel that way. She had a stroke in 2013 and was denied disability. She can’t work in accounting anymore and can’t afford her house on minimum wage income so it was foreclosed on, her heat got turned off, her water got turned off, and during one of her relapses she drove drunk, wrecked her car, spent 90 days in jail and lost her license. She was living in that house miles from town for about two years, paying to have things turned on periodically when she had money, before moving in with with a friend, also a recovering addict, who relapsed a couple of weeks ago and is dealing cocaine again. I can understand why my mom feels suicidal. She’s been let go from every job she’s gotten hired to do for the last two years, most recently for falling asleep at work, and can’t find a job to pay her fines to get her car back. 

She got out of detox and had nowhere to go but her old house and she got there and found an eviction notice. It’s snowing and she has no heat or water and she told me she had to poop outside yesterday. I don’t even think she has food there. She’s been calling long-term rehab facilities to kill two birds with one stone, but what if she doesn’t get in? I know she did this all to herself but I can’t help but feel guilty that she’s all alone and cold and hungry. 

But I have my daughter. I always swore if she relapsed she would never see her again. My husband doesn’t want her in her life, and I can’t blame him. But I know this time it wasn’t bad. This time she did the wrong thing but also did the right thing by getting help. She’s trying, which is more than she’s done sometimes in the past, and I have an empty guest room and a ton of food and heat. And I don’t know what to do. I keep crying on and off when I look at my baby. How could my mom have chosen drugs over me when I was so little and needed her? I don’t want my daughter to be hurt like I was over and over and over again. But she’s my mom and she’s trying, and she’s cold and alone. And I just don’t know what to do.

867,1.5,Yeah no problem. His name was 1980's David Bowie. We called him Bowie for short. He was a rough and tough cat. He supplemented his diet of wildlife with cat food. He hung out in ALL of my neighbors garages. If you had a project going on in your garage he was there chilling. He would be gone for a few days at a time so we really didn't notice that he had been missing. Well my neighbor comes over pretty damn forlorn. He said he found Bowie in his backyard under some plywood. He said he was pretty beat up. Now I am thinking alright he has got some cuts and needs to go to the vet. NOPE his whole ass up to the middle of his spine was skeletilized. Literaly to the bone. It had been a couple days so it was starting to dry out. Poor guy is just sitting there. He sees me and starts meowing. Trying to use his front legs to come to me. I squat next to him and start giving him some love. I had brought my .22 and my neighbor had already dug a hole. I gave him a little more love. And put him out of his misery and buried him in my neighbors backyard. My neighbor had a security camera looking out of his backyard. It was five raccoons against Bowie. Kinda using gorilla tactics. He was the best cat I ever had. Damn shame he went out like that.,"Fuck man, that's brutal. I'm glad your neighbor found him and you put him out of his misery quickly. He could have laid there for days until dying of exposure/dehydration/other predators.

My second Berner was named Bunsen and he passed away this past November. He was the most innocent, adorably goofy boy. He had disabilities and lived with pain but he was always my baby. He had so much personality and was always a sweetheart. He was pretty much a simpleton but that’s ok. He was my sunshine. My only sunshine.

* Alcohol is more than likely the cause, not the solution, to your problems of severe anxiety. Sobriety will do more to solve your anxiety problems than practically anything else you can do.
* Your real friends will stick with you if you're honest with them about what you want to do, and why. And those who don't support you aren't your real friends. You'll figure out who is who soon enough.
* Have you considered going to an AA meeting? You don't have to make a lifetime commitment to abstinence to attend — the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking, which you seem to have. Just go and see what it's like. You have nothing to lose.
* I'd also suggest reading more about alcohol and how it affects people — Annie Grace's ""This Naked Mind"" is a good place to start. She also has a great podcast.
* One thing to consider is doing a ""dry January"" or other commitment to temporary abstinence. I did this and it was extremely illuminating and accelerated my ultimate decision to abstain.

I imagine the people saying that don't understand what you're going through - maybe they never lost someone they felt so close to, but one day they might, and they will develop some perspective.

Just remember that your feelings are yours, and are not negotiable or answerable to anyone else but you. Don't let anyone draw you into defending the way you feel. If someone tries the old ""Yeah well I lost my entire family in a fire, and my dog was stolen, and my girlfriend left me. I got over it after a week, so you should too"", then you can disregard everything they say, because they are an idiot.

Grief is not a competition, and someone else's feelings do not invalidate your own. You feel what you feel, and there is no right or wrong to that.

&gt; and it's hard not to pick out all the times I could have said or done something, even if I know it wasn't those things that pushed him there.

It's OK, don't beat yourself up too badly. I still do the same - but try not to over-analyse for too long. Someone told me something that really helped me:

Even if you somehow had knowledge of what was going to happen, and if you had done everything you could have reasonably done, you may have stopped him for that day, or for that week. But the next week, or the next month, eventually he would have done it anyway. It's really not your fault.

&gt; It's hard to feel like a burden to the people I love

If you're not OK, and someone asks you, don't lie. Say so. I get that you don't want to be a burden, and sure, if you feel your colleague you speak to once a week isn't the right person to open up to, that's fine. But if someone who loves you asks if you're OK, tell them the truth. You don't need any answer or plan or know what to say next, just tell them you're not OK. If these people love you, they will want to help you. It's OK to admit when you're not OK.

Even if you just need someone to talk to for a few hours right there and then, or if you need more help, you're not going to scare away the people who really matter just because you need help - that's what family and good friends are for.

This is utterly terrible for you to go through, but you will get through it, maybe kicking and screaming at times.

4,1.0,"I don’t know whether anybody here will remember me or not. [12 days ago I left a comment talking about the recent news I’d received](https://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/8wjs70/fryday_daily_hangout_thread_july_6th_2018/e1w6ikq/), that my eldest sister had very suddenly been diagnosed with brain cancer. Nobody had known that she was physically ill until she suddenly collapsed and had to be rushed to hospital where she was immediately submitted for emergency surgery. During surgery they discovered a tumour, which they managed to remove 50% of, however we then had to wait for test results to return to discover what type of tumour it is and what the best course to proceed with would be. 

At the time I said that I would update people on how the situation has progressed. I was naively optimistic. As of 3 hours ago I received the news via a phonecall from my mum. It’s a glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain cancer, and in fact in the 12 days we’d been waiting for the diagnostic results to return, the tumour had already regrown the 50% that was initially removed during the first surgery. There’s no help for her. My sister is going to die, and very soon. 
She’s going in for more surgery today to try and remove as much of the tumour as possible, but at this stage it’s only so that they can buy her more time. She won’t live to see this Christmas.

It’s 04:50 in the morning here in the UK and I’m lying alone in my bed with nobody to talk to. I can't sleep. I can't do anything. I’ve never experienced anybody dying before, and up until today I’d never experienced true grief. Today I learned just how personal grief is. Everybody experiences it alone don't they? Even if you’re crying on the phone with your inconsolable mother, even though you both might be grieving for the same person, it doesn’t matter. You are both utterly alone in your grief and nothing and nobody can do anything to touch it.

Right now I keep alternating between some desperate sense of despair and denial, that maybe the surgery will discover something that will allow her to live, something overlooked, some kind of surgical cheat code – up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, only with a scalpel. I already know though. I know it. In a few weeks, maybe a month or two, if we’re lucky, my sister is no longer going to exist. My sister is going to die. 

I think I'm in shock. I don’t know what to do. My chest feels so tight, like some huge clawed hand is wrapped around me squeezing my ribcage painfully. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Do you know everybody but her knows right now? They haven’t told her the results yet, probably because they just recieved them and and because of her surgery that’s due soon. Everybody but her knows that she’s going to fucking die. Oh god she’s going to be so scared, and I can’t help her at all. I can't do anything. She’s only 30 years old for fucks sake. She has a son who she’s never going to get to see grow up. He’ll never know his mother. My mum told me on the phone, after she delivered the news, in between howls and choked sobs, that they’re going to start preparing things to set aside in the future for her son. Letters, photos, audio recordings, video recordings , so that he can at least come to know her in some way. Through aged scrawls and pixels. It’s too cruel. It’s too fucking cruel.

If anybody on here does happen to come across this comment and has any experience in matters of death, please, tell me how you coped with this yourself. How did you come to reconcile this? How can I lessen the pain? It hurts so much.","I am sorry this is happening, that so sad and unfair. 

I haven't lost a sibling, but I did lose a fiancé a year and a half ago; he was only 28. Death is hard to deal with all around, but it's even more acutely painful when it's a young person. The things that helped were journaling, counseling, letting myself cry, RAoAnon and going to a support group regularly.

I didn't have a chance to say goodbye, and that made things so much harder.

But asking to get better and not trying to do what it will take to get better won't fix anything. Perhaps talking to someone in real life will help. If I knew what area you were in I'd link you to some resources. If you look around, I'm sure there's some therapy you can get free of cost if you look in the right places. Perhaps calling a suicide hotline would help. You wouldn't have to talk to them if you didn't want to but they'd probably know exactly where to direct you so you can get whatever resources might help.

The big thing is, as hard as it is, you have to make the first step. Try giving up the drugs first if you want to include the girl in your life. It always feels like drugs help. They do at first. After the first few times of relief, they hurt more than they help after that.

I smoke weed and it helps my depression but if I smoke it too much it actually then enhances it. And quitting the stuff the first day always sucks but after a few you usually feel a bit better because your brain and body start going back to their normal chemical levels and such.

Who knows? After you cut out any perception altering substances like the ones you are doing, your perception of your reality will get clearer, and you may be able to easier decide what'll help you and change your current state or at least improve it. It's definitely a process.

19,1.0,"Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched.

Lots of dads out there without homes or gas money to see their kids. All the love in the world. &lt;3","I'm a grown ass man and you just made me start weeping in my cubicle...this hits WAY too close to home, except with my mom

I knew from an early age she had some mental problems, but I think what I was told was exaggerated from the truth and it made me distance myself from the ""crazy"". She would text me multiple times a day, call me all the time (so much that I would often ignore her calls, and then leave me a voicemail every time I did not answer). She was what your dad feared, an over bearing parent. 

Through high school, I maybe saw her a couple times a year and she didn't live that far from me. I remember exactly when she told me she had lung and brain cancer. I was in my apartment away at college and she called me in the morning, beginning the conversation like normal, then she hit me with it. I was so scared, but for some reason the only thing I thought to say was ""Well that's what smoking packs of cigarettes a day does to you..."" I regret saying this so much. All she said was ""...I know Kyle"". 

Her remaining years, through all her Chemo and her attempt at being reborn with her local Church, I tried my best to rekindle our relationship but I never saw her as much as I should have. It was incredibly hard since I was away at college and playing baseball for my college team. 

She told me she was going to hold on to see me graduate. She was put in hospice 2 weeks before I graduated, but luckily my college was going to be streaming the graduation ceremony on TV so she would be able to watch me graduate. 3 days before I graduated, during finals week, my mom passed away in the morning. I did not get to say goodbye. 

I got a call from my sister at 4:30 AM telling me the nurses told her that it was ""time"". I was an hour or so away and just woke up, so I hopped in the shower real quick, and sped up to the hospice. When I walked up to the hospice, I was greeted by my sister and my Aunt, who immediately started crying hysterically telling me I missed her by 10 minutes. If I did not take that shower, I would have got to say goodbye to my mom. 

As much as she ""annoyed"" me being an overbearing mom, I miss those texts everyday telling me that she loved me. To this day, I don't have any room in my voicemail mailbox because they are all voicemails I never deleted from my mom and I am too scared to listen to them. 

Even after therapy, I still feel so guilty about how I treated my own mother. All she wanted was my love, and she didn't receive nearly enough and that is my biggest regret, and I will regret that until the day I die. 

I'm sorry for going on this tangent, but once I started I couldn't stop. Please, people, do not make the same mistake I made. Life is short, way to short to be standoffish with your parents. If there is any silver lining to my story, it's that it definitely helped mine and my father's relationship.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> Do him a favour. Tell him.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back.

It turns out he's always had really bad anxiety, and felt like he was never good enough for us, like we were disappointed in him all the time.

182,1.5,I don’t think he ever loved me the same way I loved him. What does that say about me? What was wrong with me that he didn’t/couldn’t love me the same way?,"I fell madly in love with my first boyfriend and after we broke up I felt the same as you. Like it was because I wasn’t good enough. He was a successful engineer, he was big and muscular, he had a big dick, he spoke multiple languages, lived in a fancy metropolitan area. It took me years to move past it. But I DID move past it. Sure, there is a tender spot in my heart from where it got hurt, but it is nothing like it used to be. You will move on. Just make sure that in the meantime you continue to take care of yourself. Even the worst heartbreak doesn’t mean there is something wrong with you. He may have issues you aren’t even aware of.

Either way, as frustrating as dependency on lenses is, perhaps there's some consolation in that at least the condition is manageable with lenses and, secondly, there are much worse medical things that could have gone wrong with any of us than myopia inducing genes.

31,1.0,"My boyfriend just broke up with me. The day before Valentine’s Day. And I put my dog down Thursday. Kind of numb . I hope it goes away soon. How long did the pain last for you? I know we’re all different but I’m just searching for answers 

UPDATE: THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. Man, I never thought I’d have such amazing support. I feel like I grew new skin just reading everyone’s comments and messages. My nausea is subsiding with every motivational comment. Wow thanks Reddit!","About 7 years ago my ex broke up with me after 5 years of being together.  I spent about 3-4 months in the bottle or the bong.  Looking back it was dumb, but at the time, nothing else seemed to help.  It was wake up, smoke, work/video games, drink, smoke, sleep.  The only food was when I was working (worked as a server/bartender at the time) and the rest of the time I neglected my friends other than my roommates (because you just can't get the fuck away from them!) and my dog (which looking back I feel so fucking awful for).

After a few months though, I began to open up again a little.  I was still timid and scared after being hurt like I was, but I decided to at least reestablish my friendships.  It was about a year and a half before I met another girl that I felt serious about and she turned out to be fucking psycho.  I joined the military after that and met my wife 6 months after reporting to my first duty station.  We've been married for going on 5 years and have an unbelievably amazing little girl who will be 2 soon!  

My point of this stranger's anecdotal story is that life sends you through trying times and when it does, you might fall into a shell or a hole of some sort.  That's okay.  Focus on yourself for a bit and when you feel ready, get another dog.  It isn't betrayal to your old pet, after all, dogs want us to ALWAYS be happy, right?  So your previous pupper would want you to be happy with a new one!

Another guy will come around, but for now, just lean on your friends.  They're great and can help with the troubling times.  If they try to push you to move on or anything and you're not ready, tell them that.  Be honest and upfront with them.

I hope this helps a little, I know it might mean jack shit coming from a random person on the internet behind a name that sounds like dog food, but, I just felt like maybe I could impart something that might help.

72,2.0,"My Fiance died on the 31st. Her mother is absolutely milking it and is now the talk of their small town. My Fiance hated her mother. She had done so much heinous stuff to her over the years and let other family members hurt her in ways no mother ever should. But now suddenly they were the ""best of friends"" and they ""loved each other so much."" It makes me sick just to hear about this garbage. My Fiance finally moved in with me this year after basically being a prisoner for her mother. She finally gets an escape and then when she goes back to visit a cousin on labor day weekend she's gone. All the work she put in to get away from that dinky little town of people who had given up on life and in the end it took her from me. I'll always hate that place.

In terms of the ""better place"" comments, unfortunately people just do not know how to respond when something like this happens to you. It can feel very isolating. Your SO's death becomes a significant part of who you are now, but people would rather not know because it makes them uncomfortable. They may think to themselves that they're glad it didn't happen to them, or maybe they begin to think about what if their SO suddenly goes. It's a very unnerving feeling that isn't really understood. Telling yourself they're in a better place helps one brush under the rug any discomfort they may have at such thoughts. Depending on what religion one ascribes to it may also play a role.

The kids piece hits home for me. We were to be married in spring, go on our honeymoon to Europe, and come home with a hopeful baby on the way. We had concluded that her mother would never see our child to. That's how much she hated her. My Fiance wanted nothing more than to be the first and last person I married. She worked incredibly hard to move to the city where I was, to escape her little town where dreams go to die. She had many big plans with the newfound freedom she had. And then suddenly, it was all gone.

I'm still trying to find peace so I won't tell you everything will be fine, but I empathize with your frustrations, your anger, and your feelings about what your husband would have wanted. I don't think it is conceited. I've looked over my fiance's journals that she left many times. Those pages remind me every time just how much she wanted to spend her life with me.","I'm sorry for your loss, your fiancé sounds like she had it pretty rough before meeting you, it's sad for you both that you didn't get more time together.
It's so frustrating family acting like this. I sort of wonder if it's their guilt about how badly they treated our SO's in life and now their trying to make up for it? Or perhaps they really just are narcissists (that's what hubby would say lol).
I can understand people comforting themselves with the better place thing, I just wish people would think twice about saying it to me. Maybe if hubby was sick I could understand but he wasn't. I agree people just in general have no idea what to say, maybe one day I'll write a guide ""what to say and what not to say to a grieving person"" and the main point will be ""if you don't know what to say just say ""I know there's nothing I can say to help the pain but if there's anything I can do please let me know"".
For me the loss of future kids is a big component of my grief, I can imagine it is cor you too, so this guys comment was like a knife to the gut. I told a few friends at drinks on Friday, they were so surprised I handled it as calmly as I did, they were so indignant on my behalf I thought I'd have to hold them back if they say him.

389,1.0,"I'm still pretty torn up over the loss of my cat, but I've been channelling a lot of my energy into creative endeavors and I've made so much stuff!

Next week my hours at work suck,but that's actually good for me because now I have to go through the process of photographing and listing all the stuff I've made, which is going to take quite a bit of work. Thankfully my boyfriend is an awesome photographer and he also runs his own online business so he's been a real help getting me started.

I recieved my [urn pendant](https://www.etsy.com/listing/521012884/925-silver-rainbow-moonstone-cremation?ref=shop_home_active_5) from DGSilver on Etsy and it's absolutely gorgeous and got here way faster than I expected. I got a citrine stone and it matches the color of my cats eyes perfectly, it's really lovely. Along with her ashes I twined two pieces of our hair together and put it in there along with a small piece of rose quartz.

Kind of crazy, but I kind of want to get a few others, they're so pretty and you can never have too many memento mori, ya know? I was thinking I'd like one of the locket style ones.

It's very comforting to have it, although I still miss my baby every single day, I'm beginning to feel like she's always with me, she left such a big impression on my heart. I'll never forget what a special bond we had.

It felt like a fairy tale when I found her, it was such a weird chance and we were so perfect for each other. It was love at first sight. I thought she'd be with me so much longer, but I'm grateful for the time we did have.

Constantly making stuff is keeping me sane, this is the most prolific I've been in years. Even though we're not together physically, I feel like she's my muse and I just want to create beautiful things,because she was so beautiful in every single way. She loved everyone,wanted to be everyone's friend, but she loved me most of all and it might sound silly, but it felt like such an honor to be loved by such an amazing creature. 

Miss you bby :(","Fuck. My cat died Saturday from his lymphoma. Best friend for 9 years, my muse for my art. So completely smart. We met in a similar way, and I've had very few things as perfect. I understand you to a strong degree, though our situations are still only uniquely felt by us. He has helped me with so many things. The link can't be understood unless it's experienced. 

The loss doesn't go away. It's bullshit when people say that. It does transform into many other things for you throughout the rest of your life though. Always beautiful.

It doesn't matter where you find friendship in life or in what way you learn the capacity for pure love. You can meet a thousand humans and never feel that way. We are lucky we had our cats.

Sending my love. Cheers to you and your grief, I'm sharing it right along with you, and my glass of bourbon. One day we will be able to properly celebrate their lives in happiness. As Captain Kirk says, for now...'I need my pain!'

424,1.0,"tw: pregnancy loss

Had a very similar situation—husband had two SA’s with low count followed by a normal one (30 million) a month later. So, we had been planning for ICSI but were then advised to try naturally for a few more months. We were one of those nauseatingly lucky couples that got pregnant the very next cycle. Unfortunately, the baby ended up having Trisomy 18, and we lost her four months into the pregnancy. This was in February. 

We’ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get pregnant again ever since. And while it hasn’t been long enough to be concerning (currently ~7dpo in cycle 5), I’m starting to feel like we’re going to need to go the ICSI route after all. Or at least, I fear that we really *do* have fertility issues and that our one-time pregnancy was just a fluke. Didn’t even result in a live birth. Anyway...once the seed has been planted that something might be wrong, it’s hard to shake. And when you’re suddenly told to try naturally again, it’s hard to go into that with confidence.

Edited to add: My husband changed nothing between his SA’s. He didn’t have any meds to stop, no alcohol to cut back on, no exercise to start, no heated underwear to stop wearing, etc. The urologist we saw said that this was completely normal variation in count. He also said that the fact that he could *ever* mount a normal count meant that he didn’t have a problem in the first place—any problem that would cause a problematically low count would make it so that he could *never* produce a normal count. He also only had 1% morphology (this was only measured on one of the SA’s for some reason—the one that had the normal count). And the urologist was *also* unconcerned about this because he thinks the criteria for morphology are overly strict and thus meaningless (e.g., why should it matter if the sperm head is 0.1 mm shorter than the criteria allow for?). This urologist is an expert in infertility (we’re fortunate to have access to lots of experts since we live in a major New England city with lots of fancy hospitals), so I guess I trust what he has to say.","Wow thanks for responding, you put into words exactly how I feel. And so sorry about your loss. I also live in the suburb of a large city and have access to great hospitals and doctors. My RE is apparently one of the best. However, there have been a couple things that I feel like are weird. For one, after my husband’s initial bad SA, he said that in his experience urologists can’t do much to improve a situation like ours so he wouldn’t recommend going. Also, my husband told him that he takes adhd medication and the doctor immediately said that wouldn’t affect it. The research I’ve done seems to say differently. Once again, just adds to the unknown. It’s great you have a urologist that’s an expert at male infertility. I think it’s really interesting that if they are able to produce a good sample that means that nothing is wrong with them. I look forward to following your journey and wish you the best of luck!",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> tw: pregnancy loss

We’ve been trying (unsuccessfully) to get pregnant again ever since. And while it hasn’t been long enough to be concerning (currently ~7dpo in cycle 5), I’m starting to feel like we’re going to need to go the ICSI route after all. Or at least, I fear that we really *do* have fertility issues and that our one-time pregnancy was just a fluke. Didn’t even result in a live birth. Anyway...once the seed has been planted that something might be wrong, it’s hard to shake. And when you’re suddenly told to try naturally again, it’s hard to go into that with confidence.

Edited to add: My husband changed nothing between his SA’s. He didn’t have any meds to stop, no alcohol to cut back on, no exercise to start, no heated underwear to stop wearing, etc. The urologist we saw said that this was completely normal variation in count. He also said that the fact that he could *ever* mount a normal count meant that he didn’t have a problem in the first place—any problem that would cause a problematically low count would make it so that he could *never* produce a normal count. He also only had 1% morphology (this was only measured on one of the SA’s for some reason—the one that had the normal count). And the urologist was *also* unconcerned about this because he thinks the criteria for morphology are overly strict and thus meaningless (e.g., why should it matter if the sperm head is 0.1 mm shorter than the criteria allow for?). This urologist is an expert in infertility (we’re fortunate to have access to lots of experts since we live in a major New England city with lots of fancy hospitals), so I guess I trust what he has to say. </speaker> <listener> Wow thanks for responding, you put into words exactly how I feel. And so sorry about your loss. I also live in the suburb of a large city and have access to great hospitals and doctors. My RE is apparently one of the best. However, there have been a couple things that I feel like are weird. For one, after my husband’s initial bad SA, he said that in his experience urologists can’t do much to improve a situation like ours so he wouldn’t recommend going. Also, my husband told him that he takes adhd medication and the doctor immediately said that wouldn’t affect it. The research I’ve done seems to say differently. Once again, just adds to the unknown. It’s great you have a urologist that’s an expert at male infertility. I think it’s really interesting that if they are able to produce a good sample that means that nothing is wrong with them. I look forward to following your journey and wish you the best of luck! </listener>"

214,1.5,"My mom died last August and my grief has been the heaviest weight to carry, even almost 9 months out from her death. I had reconnected with her in June of 2016 and we had attempted to build a mother-daughter relationship after 7 years of estrangement.

1. Had lunch with a man and his online pictures didn’t do him justice, in person his shin was gray and his teeth were atrocious- not clean. I shouldn’t have gotten in his car... He gushed about ‘me being so awesome’, it was nauseating. After the lunch date I said ‘no thanks’. He still tried to kiss me and touch me. Then he would not stop messaging me. Not kidding 40 text messages and then he called me repeatedly. It’s when ‘No doesn’t mean NO’. 
2. Went for lunch in the park with a ‘older’ man, it was okay. He lied about his height. He said that he would drive me back to work, so I got in his truck and he lunged at me to kiss me and he actually grabbed my breasts. Lesson learned, do not get into cars with men who I don’t know very well. 
I have more examples. There are too many creepy men and women on dating sites, and my trust level and expectations are zero now.  I would much rather get to know someone at a slower pace. The fellas I’ve met are in a huge hurry to meet, and I think it’s because women post pictures of themselves 10 years younger and 100 lbs lighter.

Flexeril, upon immediate prescription of mild dosage, caused me to sleep for three days. Literally. I went to sleep, and didn't wake until three days later.

My drs don't believe that I'm in pain. Within two years, I've have had two heart attacks due to the pain and congestion, yet only one was responded to, but no one cares. Not even my Cardiologist who placed the stint.

On Wednesday we went to Chicago, IL for a second ultrasound with their MFM specialists (the week prior our twin girls were diagnosed with TTTS).
I had been having pelvic pain so we went early and they took us to OB triage.
As they tried to place an IV in the observation room my water broke.  We had just gotten to 17 weeks.
Our sweet baby girls were born &amp; died on Wednesday 6/20.

I feel like a failure, like I should have been able to do something.  My husband and the doctors, everyone has assured me that this was not my fault but I just cannot get that feeling to go away.  The fertility problems are on my end and I just feel so heartbroken.

987,1.5,"I never thought last weekend would be my last with her.  She had just turned 10 on Tuesday the 5th.  She wasn’t showing signs of major decline besides taking her time climbing the stairs.  On Thursday, she threw up her dinner, and layed on the floor and refused to move for a while.  She had done that before, as she absolutely gulped down her food, so my wife and I didn’t think anything of it.  I did carry her up the stairs to bed that night as she didn’t want to come up.

She was absolutely fine the next day, her usual appetite and energy.  I made sure to lay down on the floor with her every morning and before I went to bed every night, nuzzled my head in her neck to tell her how much I loved her, and what a good girl she was.  I was relieved to see her back to normal.  We had friends over later that night, one of whom is 6’7 who she would just stand in front of and bark at excitedly; however that night I noticed she didn’t.  

Saturday I was out all day with my kids, I made sure to give her a pat before I left.  She didn’t seem to have her usual appetite as my kids left crumbs all over the floor from their breakfast, which she usually vacuums up excitedly, that morning she just layed there on her bed.  When I came back later that day my wife mentioned that there was something wrong with Stella.  When my wife called her to come in, she found her lying underneath the chaise lounge breathing heavily, not moving.  My wife had to carry her in the house, and tried to pull her up onto her four legs.  When she did, Stella just slumped to the floor.  Thinking she may just need water we gave her some, which she eventually drank.  I sat with her on the floor and patted her head until her breathing normalized, and then we left the house.  I’m not sure if I said bye to her when I left. 

We were gone for a few hours, and when we came back to the house she had passed away in front of the kitchen sink.  We ushered our kids up the stairs quickly before they could see her.  They knew something was wrong as my wife was sobbing, and I was in shock.  I carried her body out of the house and lay her on the grass in a dark area do that my kids could say a final goodbye to our girl.  It was one of the hardest things I have ever done as a parent, telling my boys that Stella passed away.  

Our family is still devastated, she was an amazing part of our family, and it is really difficult to accept that she is gone, but Talking about it helps me get through each day.

Update- thank you so much for your support.  It has helped me immensely.  Now instead of searching for answers as to why this happened, asking whether or not we could have done something different to prevent this, I can focus on remembering the good times, laughter, and great memories she brought to our lives.

I had injured my elbow about 4 years ago. I had pulled my ulnar nerve out from between the crevasse of bone in my inner elbow. That took over two years to fully heal enough for me to do upper body again. I finally started benching again and over did it because I was too excited. ended up getting shoulder tendonitis that hasnt healed for over a year. Then right after that someone pushed down on my hip when i was laying down and pulled my lower back which prevented me from squatting and deadlifting.

I'm so happyto be back but it's still hurting me occasionally. I'm afraid I'll just live with these injuries pestering me forever honestly, but at least i'm able to do more things than I was.


depending on what you have, I might be able to give you some pointers to help? Rock climbing has deifnitely helped build my shoulder muscle back up and I'm able to low bar squat again. For my lower back I did a lot of different exercises and stretches, and for my elbow I had to do like 2 years of PT so I have a lot of things for that lol.

863,1.0,"Thanks for asking!  I suppose I'm okay, as I don't have a choice other than to be okay.  I had to delay taking the CA bar exam because of all of this, but whatever, sometimes things don't work out as planned.

As for my husband, after much medical testing, we don't have many answers.  He doesn't have a brain tumor.  His neurologist was sure he had M.S. because he has all the symptoms, except he doesn't have lesions that would show up on an MRI.  

Our insurance pretty much denied further testing, so his neuro settled on fibromyalgia with chronic migraines, which is sort of a b.s. result in my opinion.  I've talked to several people with M.S. who said their symptoms started exactly like my husband's, and their lesions sometimes didn't show up for 4-5 years after the chronic migraines.  His doctor tried to do a follow up MRI, and our insurance hassled us in paying it, and made it such a pain that I think they intentionally did it as a warning to not submit to further testing.  It sucks because I used to have really fantastic insurance 7-8 years ago, but even though we're with the same company, they deny everything, and make us submit appeal after appeal.

Otherwise, now that the stress of owning a business is gone, my husband is physically doing better...until he has stress.  His migraines are also set off by elevation changes and bright lights.  Fun stuff.

Our insurance pretty much denied further testing, so his neuro settled on fibromyalgia with chronic migraines, which is sort of a b.s. result in my opinion.  I've talked to several people with M.S. who said their symptoms started exactly like my husband's, and their lesions sometimes didn't show up for 4-5 years after the chronic migraines.  His doctor tried to do a follow up MRI, and our insurance hassled us in paying it, and made it such a pain that I think they intentionally did it as a warning to not submit to further testing.  It sucks because I used to have really fantastic insurance 7-8 years ago, but even though we're with the same company, they deny everything, and make us submit appeal after appeal.

Otherwise, now that the stress of owning a business is gone, my husband is physically doing better...until he has stress.  His migraines are also set off by elevation changes and bright lights.  Fun stuff.  

 </speaker> <listener> Thanks for sharing, and CONGRATULATIONS on getting the business sold!!! That must have been such a relief for the both of you.

How gracious and kind of you to take it all in stride. It's heartbreaking to hear the healthcare system has been so unsatisfactory and shown so many signs of being unreliable.

You are doing so much for your husband and sharing with him what's more important than anything else - love.

Hope you hang in there, that your work situation has improved, and that you are able to take care of yourself and find help when you need it. And good luck with the studying! </listener>"

240,3.0,"Story since I do need to vent: Her and I had dated despite her circumstances. To not go in all of the detail in the world, she was Jehova's Witness but couldn't find a way out of the religion because rightfully so she loved her family. We worked and talked about this extensively but given her age and reliance on her family, she wasn't able to readily leave. Which was fine. Over time, other aspects of abuse from her parents surfaced and I tried my best to help her with the little bit I knew. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do much because her reaction to any form of confrontation regardless of how light was to get immediately defensive and an imminent complete shut down. This made talking about our problems a prolonged and impossible ordeal. 

Over time I found it difficult to talk to her because of these things. We grew fairly distant and a lot of the things we enjoyed doing together disappeared slowly. Either she would blow me off for streaming her game or I would be busy doing other things to unwind. Even so, we would fall asleep together every night, talk, spend time together. Try our best.

We got into a huge argument one night in which she was angry I'd stopped trying to open up to her or talk to her about problems and I got immensely frustrated and told her that it was because she was impossible to talk to. I did not know how to talk to her. She would shut down. She doesn't do anything to overcome this despite how long we've tried. 

I've had to date this woman in secret, while she lied to her parents, friends, and everything essentially became virtual. There are times she would have to delete photos of us and I stored them on USB's or resend them. When I'd visit her (she lived a few hours away), she would refuse to help with any of the expenses despite having a  decent job. Especially after I was let go from my previous job because it went under. Not visiting resulted in an understanding but her crying and the pain she felt would swallow me so i'd sacrifice to do so. 

Though she would stay up to wait for me, she never bother reciprocating anything. While I was making a very moderate living and spending wasn't an issue at the time, the first sign of trouble and explaining to her why I felt I couldn't talk to her was the end result of her emasculating me. While I understood that this was her inability to comprehend my issues because her parents are well off and she's well taken care of, it hurt me that this disconnect due to our inability to communicate or me finding a way for us to comfortably talk resulted in this. I put so much of the weight and blame on myself as a slightly older person and more experienced person but I realized painfully slow that this wasn't something I could handle anymore. I tried desperately to find ways and hid my problems in light of me finding a new job (second shift / 70k -- 40k pay cut after incentives and bonuses are factored in) while having to take care of a mentally challenged mother and assist my grandparents as my grandmother begins to lose her life. In this plight I lost one of my brothers very young to a horrible accident and I felt as if I was under water for over a year. 

So painfully so, we broke up. 

We were fine for a while but she started challenging me about things during the break up. I had ordered her a very cheap necklace with what I presumed was enough Amazon Credit but I didn't have enough and I had to swap cards. I didn't check this until after the holidays and reordered on Saturday morning. She threw a fit about this. After I showed her the evidence on the matter, she began telling me she was angry at me and we shouldn't talk for the night. I said if we don't find a way to talk now then we wont ever. She challenged me more and I snapped, asked when was the last time she offered to do things for me. That there's givers and there are takers and she's just the latter. Why do I have to feel as if the burden of all this nonsense is on me? When has she apologized for being wrong? Or tried to help me?

Mid way, she laughed and hung up.

So I walked away. I deleted and blocked everything. 

It's been a while but I'm still overwhelmed by it and it's eating me up. I blame myself for so much and I feel stupid because I have seen these red flags and I ignored them because I was obsessed with the idea of not losing a relationship regardless of the context. It hurts to see things end because I want to be a friend. I am fine with us being apart, but I can't help but feel that we would have eaten each other up in all the wrong ways. 

So I haven't been able to sleep and here I am, brothers. I needed to vent. Thanks for reading. 

Edit: I'm sure she has her perspective and it's equally painful. I don't deny it. I think about it a lot but this is how I felt and I could never talk to her or tell her these things. We never got the chance to really sift through it after all.

Edit 2: For anyone who is confused, my ex and I would obviously fall asleep on the phone together. I just wanted to clarify this. 

Also, I've scheduled a few appointments this week with a friend to speak with therapists on my personal matters. Thank you all for being there for me. I appreciate all of you.","I'm so, so sorry, that sounds incredibly difficult.

That is why many states have The Good Samaritan law in place. It gives the 911 caller (and I think the person ODing)  immunity from getting arrested, even if more drugs were found on the scene.

Also, narcan should be easier to get. In some states its very easy, over the counter and free. In other states, its much more difficult to get. And you might need a prescripton for it, which also costs about $150 per dose.

Hopefully get out of this shit, and  make some sort of play that will recover my principle, rebuild, and then get the fuck out like I should have last week. Getting smacked down for being greedy and ignorant is a tough lesson. But I guess better now then never. Thanks for reading if you did, just needed to get off my chest. Can't talk to anyone else. </speaker> <listener> Been in your shoes. Lost $10K earlier this year, got carried away thought I had a serious problem. Picked up a second part-time job, cut back expenses. Made it all back and some in 6 months. Jumped in again with better strategy than just YOLO weeklies. I'm still losing money and I still don't think this is for me. Buy and hold seems better, the point is, you're young and its a relatively cheap life lesson long term. Learn from it, dont fall back into your old ways and move on. It may be hard to digest now but in 5 months you will see it as a learning experience. </listener>"

I had a great group of friends, classes weren’t difficult enough to make me stressed, I had enough time to work to fund clothing purchases, overall life was good.

65,1.0,"I do not come from a Jewish background, but when I had my son at age 20, it was just assumed that we were performing a circumcision.   I signed off on the paperwork,  as it's, what I thought, an expected procedure.  Once I got him back and saw the damage (not a botched procedure, everything went well) I felt sick.  Only then did I look up how it was done, strapped down to a board, no anesthesia,  and cut.  I was horrified that I had allowed such a barbaric thing to be done to my baby, and have regretted it ever since.  It is the one decision as a parent I wish I could change.

Don’t beat yourself up over it. My mother had me even younger (fresh out of high school, a month into 18) and got me cut basically for the same reasons. She was a new parent, with a lot of brand new territory in front of her. The medical professionals she trusted told her “its the right thing to do”, so she followed their advice. She’s not nor has she ever been a doctor. I cannot reasonably fault her for putting her trust in the people she was supposed to.

Truthfully, it’s unlikely your son will grow up to be like me and resent his circumcision. Many men don’t. But if he does, being able to say you’re sorry, and that you wish you can change it is probably the best (and only) thing you need to say.

61,1.5,"I hope it does relax because the discomfort is really beginning to unnerve me a little. I just want to be able to speak freely without feeling like somebody is physically pulling at my vocal chords. I can't even raise my voice without it hurting. It feels very wrong, weird, and I can't stop feeling ugly inside. If only I wasn't so stubborn and useless, I could have stopped a month ago, just when the negative thoughts started to pile up on me, but I didn't, and this is something I'm going to have to carry on my back for the rest of my days...

For some stupid reason I kept on trying to convince myself that the longer I stay on T, the more ""used to it"" I would become, and the less awkward I would feel about the changes. I really didn't want to be wrong. I spent so long mulling this over, I just didn't want to face the fact that I was wrong, because being wrong meant I was deceiving everyone, and I never wanted to make out that I was lying. Yet here I am, finally admitting to myself that being on testosterone was a mistake... that I shouldn't have done it... and it hurts...

I know I shouldn't be this upset, things could have been much worse, I should be thankful that it was only 3 months, but I just can't handle the fact that it was me who put me into this situation in the first place... nobody else told me to go on hormones... this was my own choice....

I'm really really sorry for pouring my heart out like this. I don't even know what you may be going through right now, you've been on T for much longer than I have, and here's me rambling on about my damn issues! I just keep feeling really disconnected from the world right now, there's just nobody available to share this with, the people out there who've been with me throughout this entire transition, I don't even know what they're going to think of me anymore... I'm nothing but a delusional freak. 

As silly as this sounds, I've even be driving myself crazy with the thought of putting myself back on testosterone just so my voice can break and the knotted feeling in my throat can end. I know this means I'll only end up hurting myself further, but if my voice breaks at least I could try and speak in a softer voice instead of being stuck with this permanent monotonous voice... I know I'll sound like a man, but maybe if I tried voice training to get it to sound more feminine, maybe I could handle this if it means I won't be having any more sore throats... 

The sore throats ended up starting a while back, they're a little worse now, I'm scared of it remaining like this... 

&amp;#x200B;","Hey, it’s okay. This is a really, really stressful thing to go through. I was in the same, overwhelmed position as you just a little over a month ago. You feel ugly and like there’s no way you can go back to living a normal life, I know. But the good thing is that you can. 

It’s really hard to admit when you’re wrong. And it’s even harder to accept when you’ve made a mistake and hurt yourself, and you have no one to blame but your own poor decision making. It’s really hard to go through, and you should take some time for yourself. But first of all; forgive yourself. You’re not ugly. I know how disgusting you can feel sometimes, being a cis girl who has had male hormones in her body and having to deal with all the manly after effects. It’s really hard especially because girls are so ridiculed and told they’re worthless if they have deep voices or body hair or aren’t good at being feminine. Those reasons are part of why I even started HRT in the first place. 

But you’re not ugly. You’re beautiful. No matter how you look, you are. I know it’s hard to really believe and feel, I struggle to feel like I am too. But I promise you that this gets better. I don’t know what your favorite things to do are, but do whatever you know will bring you happiness for a while. I myself just OVERCOMPENSATED, so hardcore for a while to feel more “worthy” of being female, because I didn’t at first at all. I did some pretty dumb shit, like waxed all my body hair off, plucked my facial hair out (all over my chin and shit, augh), started wearing heavy makeup every day, went on birth control,bought a push up bra and lots of panties.... of course, this is certainly not everyone’s cup of tea at all, but I just did everything I could to make myself feel like a “normal girl” because I just didn’t feel like one or like I was good enough to be one at all. But in just one month, I’m already so much happier. I really promise you’ll be okay.

Try treating your cracking voice as a sore throat or cold! Drink lots of hot tea with lemon and honey. Do salt water gargles. Drink lots of water, and try to rest your voice. You honestly may also have just caught a cold or something, it is starting to get colder and all. And even if you didn’t, being kind to your voice may help it relax. 

Anyway, best of luck. Feel free to talk to me at all if you need support, I know how scary this all is.

89,1.0,"Well let's see, been fired from most of the jobs I've taken, booted out of the military after I got injured, two failed marriages, two-three failed attempts at college depending on how you count, and a kid I haven't seen in seven years. No second places there. Dead last in every race. The world would be better without me but my two failed suicide attempts have steered me clear of proactive solutions. I guess my experience could benefit someone else. Don't be a fuckup, kids.","Okay, I am not a professional.  I am only a guy who values logic and critical thinking in all aspects of life.  But here are my recommendations:

1) Go see a professional.  They can really help you put things in perspective, and conquer them,

2) Look at each event and tell yourself, as honestly as possible, why they happened.  Whether it was your fault, someone else’s fault, or a freak accident few could have predicted.  Find the cause for each incident.

3) Decide what YOU would or could do differently now (no matter who or what caused the situation).  

Understand that there are infinite variations we can make in EVERY choice that can change the outcome.  No choice is ever only one way or the other, and nothing else.  There are infinite variables around the choice that you can manipulate.

Don’t settle for a solution you don’t like, but don’t force a solution the other parties involved wouldn’t like either.  Find one of the infinite variations that could work for everyone.

4) I was suicidal once, and thought of myself as a total failure.  So I can tell you what helped me.

I was watching Conan the Barbarian (Arnold Swartzenneger, James Earl Jones), and in it, James Earl Jones is the big bad guy who enthrals people to be his slaves.  He commands one slave to jump to her death onto a wooden platform far below.  She dies, and breaks through the platform.  James Earl Jones says, “That is the power of a human life.” (Or something like that).

I realized right there that whether I value myself or not, just being a human with the ability to manipulate things, to learn, to change myself and my surroundings, is VERY powerful.  Sure, everyone can do it, but we forget how amazing it is.

So I decided if I was going to kill myself, I would die doing something I believed in.  If I wanted to help the poor, I would pour my all into helping the poor.  If I wanted to become a ninja, I would pour my all into becoming a ninja.  If I was ready to die anyway, it wouldn’t matter.  So I could do anything.

There’s a Reddit post around here with the same idea:  Suicidal people should go do something amazing, so they either go out being awesome, or go out helping people.  And maybe, on the way, they learn to value themselves, and/or life.  But it doesn’t have to be that extreme.

5) You are valuable, so take some time to list what you can do that is valuable, and what you believe in that you could put your efforts into.  And don’t give up if things go slowly, or change doesn’t happen as fast as you’d like at whatever you choose to do.

I'm a fairly anxious person and a *sort-of* reformed people-pleaser. In the past I've bent over backwards for people to the detriment of my own health, so it's something I try really hard to avoid.  This past year I've had a childhood friend resurface, who has just gone through an ugly divorce, and is living with her grandmother and recovering addict sister.  She has very little money and is trying to find a job, while her family expects her to take care of everyone she's living with.  While I love her and want to be a supportive friend, she's been incredibly demanding, often calling me late at night or when I'm at work.  I've tried to maintain boundaries by not picking up the phone or replying to every text, while letting her know that I do love and support her.  Yesterday things came to a head when I gently tried to let her know that once I got home I would be putting my phone away so I could focus on my husband, but that she should send me an email of everything she wanted to say so I could reply to it in the morning.  She did not react well.  She accused me of being dishonest about how I felt about her, and said that texting and emails were incredibly unhelpful and wasn't this supposed to be about her?  Then when I tried to point out that I couldn't support her in the way that she wanted due to my commitments and needs, she laid on the guilt, kept apologizing for being annoying and said she'd stop bothering me from that point on.

I tried not to let it destroy my night, but it really hurt.  I totally recognize that she is being manipulative because she doesn't want boundaries, but it still hurts me because I want to be a supportive friend and she's been dealing with a truly horrible situation.  I'm still upset about it this morning and part of me doesn't want to deal with it anymore, which doesn't make me feel better about myself.

Well done you, for being supportive and strong for the rest of your family.  They'll appreciate it so much. Remember that while stress and exhaustion is to be expected, you should take a wee bit of time for yourself too (even if it's just standing outside under a tree for 5 minutes with your headphones on, listening to the boys).

I'm trying to take care of things for my parents and other brother, but I'm so stressed and tired.

I'm sorry for sharing this here, I just needed say something somewhere, and since I've been using bangtan as my strength, this was the only place that came to mind. </speaker> <listener> Oh, darlin, I'm so, so sorry to hear that.  

My younger brother died 5 years ago so I recognise where you are right now. 

Well done you, for being supportive and strong for the rest of your family.  They'll appreciate it so much. Remember that while stress and exhaustion is to be expected, you should take a wee bit of time for yourself too (even if it's just standing outside under a tree for 5 minutes with your headphones on, listening to the boys).

The next day or two will be a whirlwind, I imagine, but busy is good.  It helps it pass.  I hope you have a good support network to rely on over the next few weeks, and are able to take a wee bit of time off from work/study? I found it helpful and soothing to do things that reminded me of him but weren't overly taxing (playing the OG Pokémon games, listening to songs we loved, cooking his favourite meals) and sleeping tons.  Like, HOURS and HOURS.  Your body and brain will thank you for it. 

If you need to talk just let me know, any time.  Take care, love, you're doing great x </listener>"

693,1.0,"I guess it's time for me to make an actual post after lurking here for 3 years. I'm a 30 year old Air Force vet. I was Security Forces in the AF (basically military police) and served one tour in Iraq where I was injured during an attack. I'd rather avoid the details of the attack but the injuries are to my wrist and lower back, it's chronic debilitating pain. On top of that I have pretty severe PTSD to the point where I can't play most of the cool new video games with my friends that I am really interested in (Battlefield 1, PUBG, even Overwatch is difficult).  
All of this has completely screwed my chances of being employed. I get a pension from the VA but it's exactly enough to keep the roof over my head and afford groceries. That's mostly fine because the PTSD doesn't really work well with clubing and night life/social life. 
The VA's answer is to load me up on SSRIs and Oxy, it's disgusting the amount of Oxy I have in my medicine cabinet. I did that stuff for awhile, like a lot of it for a long while to where the days started to blend together and I was basically a drugged up vessel devoid of feeling and emotion. I had to give it up and an old friend helped me by introducing me to kratom.  
It's been nearly two years and I haven't touched oxy or the prozac because I just haven't felt the need for it. Kratom does everything those medications do and more. I've managed to get out to friends places for board game nights and socializing, I'm a lot happier, I get a consistent night sleep, I find enjoyment in holidays. I just feel like a human again.  
However, it's hard for me to order kratom because my budget is so tight, what little amount I can order is usually the Gaia sampler pack and that runs out quick! Most of you may think that's a lot of kratom and it should last me a month, I get that, but it doesn't. I can't even begin to tell you how awful my pain is, I dose a lot because I **have** to. There have been days where I have to call my sister to come help me out of bed because my back is so tightly locked up. Just typing that last sentence and reading it to myself makes me tear up. I'm fucking 30 man! This pain, this struggle is for life.  
Anyway, it feels foreign for me to share my problems on the internet but this sub seems genuinely welcoming so there's my little piece of it.  

Also I entered the Gaia contest, does anyone know who won?  

Edited for grammar.","Wow! I’m sorry you are going through all of that stress and pain.. also Thankyou very much for serving for us in Iraq. It means a lot to us citizens. Kratom has also saved me from my physical and metal struggles and I don’t know where I would be without it. 

Plus I’m not sure who won. Gaia said they would post the winners tonight but there are no updates. I would probably suggest looking tomorrow. More than likely they never got the chance to post it. I entered myself. But if I win I’m going  to give it to a close friend of mine. He needs it more than I do. He’s a victim of opiate addiction and kratom has literally saved his life.

I did that stuff for awhile, like a lot of it for a long while to where the days started to blend together and I was basically a drugged up vessel devoid of feeling and emotion. I had to give it up and an old friend helped me by introducing me to kratom.  
It's been nearly two years and I haven't touched oxy or the prozac because I just haven't felt the need for it. Kratom does everything those medications do and more. I've managed to get out to friends places for board game nights and socializing, I'm a lot happier, I get a consistent night sleep, I find enjoyment in holidays. I just feel like a human again.  
However, it's hard for me to order kratom because my budget is so tight, what little amount I can order is usually the Gaia sampler pack and that runs out quick! Most of you may think that's a lot of kratom and it should last me a month, I get that, but it doesn't. I can't even begin to tell you how awful my pain is, I dose a lot because I **have** to. There have been days where I have to call my sister to come help me out of bed because my back is so tightly locked up. Just typing that last sentence and reading it to myself makes me tear up. I'm fucking 30 man! This pain, this struggle is for life.  
Anyway, it feels foreign for me to share my problems on the internet but this sub seems genuinely welcoming so there's my little piece of it.  

Also I entered the Gaia contest, does anyone know who won?  

Edited for grammar. </speaker> <listener> Wow! I’m sorry you are going through all of that stress and pain.. also Thankyou very much for serving for us in Iraq. It means a lot to us citizens. Kratom has also saved me from my physical and metal struggles and I don’t know where I would be without it. 

Plus I’m not sure who won. Gaia said they would post the winners tonight but there are no updates. I would probably suggest looking tomorrow. More than likely they never got the chance to post it. I entered myself. But if I win I’m going  to give it to a close friend of mine. He needs it more than I do. He’s a victim of opiate addiction and kratom has literally saved his life. He is also short on money since his fiancé was let go of her job. </listener>"

775,1.5,"My dog is dead. My dog is fucking dead.

My father failed to close the backyard gate properly a few days ago. During my dog's resulting unsupervised exploration of the neighborhood, she fell into a ditch. She couldn't get out. My father wasn't home at the time, so one of our neighbors called the police to rescue her, identify her, and return her. Father sent a short video showing Puppy's condition a couple of days ago, and she was a complete fucking mess. She looked like a hyena. She could barely fucking move her back legs. She wouldn't eat. And then she would eat and she started having fucking diarrhea again. And my father woke up this morning and she was dead. I'm currently on another continent. The last time I saw her was June 15.

I'm sorry if I end up sounding like a generic edgelord, but please allow  me to saw a few things. I am tired. The only consistent friend I've had through a good portion of my life is dead. I am alive. This isn't the first time something similar has happened. I am still alive. Between the two of us, I should not be. My dog was friendly and welcoming. She was stupid, I think even she knew it, but she did what she could and actually made me feel like there was something worth getting out of bed for. That's far more than I've ever done for anyone.

Puppy's body will be cremated. My sister wants the ashes. I don't care. They aren't Puppy.","It's not edgy to be sad about shit. It's fucking cancer that all the 13 year olds on the internet have made you feel that way with all their ""loloLOLl xDD le edgyiii1! thing i dont like is edgy!! ahah aso EMO!"" garbage. 

Death is a grim subject, and your outlook will probably be pretty grim for a good while because you've had death in your life very recently. Allow yourself time to grieve, and don't give a shit about anyone who thinks you're being melodramatic. 

Those people are the sheltered little cunts that have never had lost anyone they really cared about, and they're talking out of their ass because they don't have the experience to recognize what's actually going on with your feelings.

Don't pay attention to that kind of criticism and give yourself time to grieve. It'll get better.

36,2.0,"i don't usually take part in these discussions because i generally feel like my problems aren't as severe as other people's and i'm making a big deal out of everything and i'm not even diagnosed with anything so i feel i have no place to complain, but all my shit's been getting worse and worse very quickly all of a sudden so i am going to because i don't really have anyone who i can completely openly talk about this with without annoying them

well i'll start off with i'm a 14 year old which will probably turn quite a few people away already, but i feel if i'm gonna talk about anything here i should probably clarify some things. i'm from the uk, i'm completely out to everyone and my parents took it rly well, so that's not even an issue here

i have a few different things that are prompting me to ask here. first off is school and schoolwork. i am in year 10 (that would be freshman-age for american fish) and so am working towards my gcse's. i regret a lot of my choices. i picked art which was stupid because i can't draw and i don't have any good ideas ever, but i mostly picked it because i enjoy art and want to learn and have fun and, if i can, pass. but my teacher hates me, she needs to see all the work i'm doing because she doesn't trust i'll do it right, and it's causing my so much stress. i'm dreading every art lesson i have and am also concerned i'll snap and argue back with my teacher because i can never hold my tongue. also we're doing our school production at the moment, which is fucking terrible. i auditioned for a main part, fucked up unimaginably and obviously didn't get a main. the whole show has been handled so badly, all the principle cast are essentially telling us ensemble cast to try harder when we've done the best with what we've got. it's just, once again, a lot of fucking stress. then my biggest school related problem is that i have just no drive to do anything, any school work, any anything. every time i tell a friend this they just go 'omg me i hatteeeee homework' but then are passing everything and have fucking pages of revision notes, whereas i struggle to even pick up a pen outside of school to do homework. i'm good at hiding it though by doing the bare minimum and bullshitting my way through teacher's questions, but i'd rather just have the will to actually do the work. then i can preface the next thing i'm gonna say is that i know i'm young and it shouldn't be an issue for me, but as long as i'm here saying everything on my mind then i may as well: i'm just so concerned about my future. like i don't have any talents that could translate into a future job. i love drama, but i've been told i'm shit so many times i'm kind of just losing the ambition there, drag is what i wanna do really because i love fashion and all of drag history just interests me so much and just everything involved i love. but that is very unrealistic and i'm probably not good enough so :/

one of the other things that is contributing to my overall demeanor is i may or may not be going out with someone. it's an extremely confusing situation. he's out and bi and is like the only other out guy in my year, except he's really popular while i'm (admittedly i get along with almost everyone, but i'm not popular i'm just not hated) not. we started talking in november, and i got a really big crush on him because i'm a fucking idiot. i asked him out, he said yes, then we were gonna go out numerous times but it didn't work for multiple reasons (he's not out to his parents and he's been in a lot of trouble with school and shit recently meaning it just never really went anywhere. but i know for a fact he liked me back which sucks. then we've started talking again recently, and we get along well and i'm thinking of asking him just what this is sometime soon, but i'm just really easily overwhelmed. there are other things as well like for a period of time it was a love triangle with a year 11 boy involved as well, and also one of his (female) ex's friends was spreading rumors about him because her whole group has been pretty homophobic towards him. and we were trying to keep us talking and maybe going out on the downlow since he isn't out and there are assholes in our school but somehow everybody found out. i know the obvious solution is just to cut contact so i stop liking him and can get over him and get rid of all this unnecessary stress, but i have to see him at school everyday anyway, and i know if this did work out, even only for a little, it would really make me feel better just about all my school stuff because i'd have someone there. so as much as i know it's probably the wrong decision for me, i'm trying to make it work

then homelife is kinda shit, both my parents have alcohol problems (my dad much moreso than my mum), and my dad tends to be an asshole a lot of the time, when he's sober he's actually pretty good, but that's like 30% of the time. and this once again might be me being melodramatic, but as much as i recognize that my parents love each other, i can tell you they wouldn't still be together if they didn't have me. in fact my mum has openly told me that she would leave my dad if she had enough money to move out. so that's kinda shitty

putting everything together i feel like i may have depression (and anxiety maybe?). i've talked to a few friends who have been formally diagnosed and i've described how i feel to them and generally they agree, and additionally my dad has hereditary depression, so it wouldn't shock me. now this may be a little further, but i've done a lot of research (in the time i probably should've been doing my homework) and am considering i may be bipolar. i have mood swings disconcertingly often, lack of energy, relatively short attention span. i never really experience high highs, but i often switch quickly between a average/happy mood to a depressed, wants to fall back into self harm mood. oh yeah i haven't cut in a while (thanks u/xPigingtunx). i used to cut a lot but i've managed to avoid it recently. and i am pretty sure i have anorexia, and know i had bulimia for a short period of time but that was only about two weeks and long enough ago that that doesn't really concern me anymore. but yeah i struggle to eat a meal a day even, and manage to get by on very little sleep and food.

i feel bad for posting this and am positive i won't be taken seriously. i'm a 14 year old complaining about how shit my life is and saying a bunch of shit that is all in my head. i feel stupid tbh but i've written so much and stayed up an hour longer than i wanted to so i'm not deleting this all now regardless. but if you've read this far, i'm not sure what i'm asking for. i don't know if i'm asking for advice? for sympathy? for a place to rant? i think i'm just asking at this point","Hang in there!

We were together for 3+ years. Best friends for 7 years before that. In the last year of the relationship it felt like he was always working against me. Instead of it being the two of us against life stresses, he would blame me and we were no longer a team. I think he started to resent me because of my disability. I couldn't do the things I could do before. My mobility is affected and I guess I stopped being ""fun"". 

I don't feel the need to be in a relationship. I was on tinder after the break up because I wanted to enjoy being single and figuring out who I am and just meeting people and having a good time. This guy M just blind sided me to be honest. I wasn't expecting it to be more than a fan situation but i feel a connection with him that has made me start falling for him.

I think I am good company! My issue is that with my disability I can't work so all I do is sit at home and be lonely and it is quite isolating but I have lots of interests and i keep up with news and events and do research so that my mind stays as active as possible despite not being able to physically do much. 

My self esteem is damaged partly because of my disability because I'm not who I was and I'm having a hard time accepting that. I still get very upset at the life I no longer have. I feel like I'm a stain on society because I can't contribute with working and taxes and stuff and that gets me down. I've always been taught that I can do anything and I've always worked hard but this is a huge struggle and though I hope to learn how to manage so I can eventually work, it's taking a very long time. 

Another reason behind my low self esteem is my relationship with my ex. There was an event where he tried to gaslight me and I called him out on it but after we split I realised that was one of many times he did that, it just didn't work that one time. He blamed me for so many things and just made me feel like I was a burden more than anything else. After the split, i realised a lot and realised that I am not those things but the insecurity still creeps in and makes me feel like I'm not good for anything. The last year we were together, he had just graduated and neither of us were working. I somehow managed to keep us financially afloat for a year but it was getting to the end of that time and that's when he broke up with me... essentially I couldn't pull anymore money out of my arse so he had to get a job. Breaking up around that time made me feel like I was no longer useful to him so he broke up with me","(these are my observations as a human in the wild, i'm not a professional, just an ear to listen, as it were)

was he with you before your disability or was he there when it began?  the way i see it, if that's the case, then you didn't change, he did.  that has nothing to do with you.  i can relate to this very much though my own outcome was different.  

your ex -- not many good things to say about him, but at the end, i'd say you're better off without him and his baggage in your life.  he didn't want to work and expected you to?  is that why he resented your disability?  you can't let him live rent-free in your head.  do you think you live in his?

787,1.5,"Holy shit today. I am so stressed. What even is my life.

1. Woke up, actually thought today was gonna be a good day. I had good lessons prepared and ready to go, I slept in a little more than usual, AWESOME
2. Immediately, flat tire. Go to fill up air, but....flat tire. Immediately text my supervisor dude who **gives me a super sarcastic response** and call Ford. Having a panic attack right now, btw. Hyperventilating and crying.
3. Turns out I have a spare tire (who knew?) and he put that on.
4. Got to work BARELY LATE but before I could start class my supervisor dude wanted me to go into his office before I went to class so he could yell at me about how I don't communicate enough.
5. Classes were ok. Mostly just cried during my planning because of stress and the fact that I looked up how spare tires are only meant to be driven about 50 miles under 50mph...after driving 50 miles at 60+mph.
6. Went to tire place to get tire patched. Needs to be replaced. New tire costs $100, used costs $30. I have $22 on my credit card and -$220 in the bank. So I sit in the lobby trying to figure out what to do. I don't think I let any tears out, but I was about to cry. I think the people eventually took pity on me cuz they eventually just gave me the tire for free. I had to put it on myself (which I learned how to do just now)
7. Got an email from my landlady scolding me for not taking out the recycling today (wtf???). Not the biggest thing today but my pot was already boiling over.

I...honestly was planning to end my life tonight. Drive down to Fredericksburg and drive off the bridge into the Rappahannock.

58,1.0,I feel sick just imagining it . I feel this special kind of rage which I have never felt before . I am packing her shit right now I just want her things out of my space . I honestly can't talk or look at her without being repulsed sick to my core,"I've had something similar happen to me my friend. I didn't eat for a few days, I acted like a fool trying to get her back for a few weeks, I took out my anger on others for the next few years. I know the sickness you are feeling, and it would be my goal to help you do the least as possible damage to yourself as possible. 

You have the very unique opportunity to become a god among men here, to exit this situation completely, without any sort of fiasco or embarrassment. When people ask what happened, you have the opportunity to give the ULTIMATE burn, the ultimate win... ""She was unfaithful with my best friend, and neither of them are in my life anymore."" That's all you will say, and then change the conversation. 

Done. To those that know all of you, if you show that you are handling this with maturity, you will be given incredible respect. They will be shocked by your strength. So, that's the exterior stuff you should do. 

On the inside, I know you are a wreck. Stick around places like this to get good support. Here are the things I did to help me. 

1. Go to the gym and beat the shit out of a punching bag. Get a trainer, tell them you want to be an animal in 6 months. Put your fire into forging yourself into something completely new. 
2. Hit up old flames that understand you are not looking for something serious, who can provide you with comfort and support. I had a few good women in my life that really helped me keep my head up with just someone to text and flirt with. 
3. Move, if you want. Luckily I got out of that town and if I looked back to see where him and her where, it would probably be very depressing. Where I once felt anger, I now just feel sadness for them. They are about to experience the same pain you are in a different way, something worse. They have to live with what they did to you, and that's going to be haunting. 
4. Use your family and friends. Again, no one will ever give you anything but respect and help in a situation like this IF you continue to take the high road. 

I hate to say this because no one likes generic advice like this, but it's true. Ask yourself, ""Will this matter in 5 years?"" And as someone who looked back after 5 years, no, it will not matter. It will make you much stronger, and much kinder to others.

353,1.0,"So I told a 'close friend' just a couple of minutes ago that I was watching fancams of the BTS concert and he was like 'that is still going on?' as in 'my obsession'. 

I failed an important exam in May. Like THE most important for my career. It was devastating, I was in another country, away from family and... as much as I hate to say this, on the brink of a breakdown. For some reason, as I was randomly scrolling through Youtube, I discovered this video of a bunch of guys reacting to their MV. I had seen that MV before but never really put much thought to it. I loved their reactions. I wanted to know their names. I watched the MV again and one of the guys did a jacket flip... and then it began. 

I started going through Bangtan Bombs. I loved their quirks, their antics, their randomly-start-singing moments. I smiled when J-hope said he was our hope. I smiled when I saw glimpses of Jin through his shell. I smiled when I saw Tae being an absolute sweetheart. I smiled when I saw Suga preparing those little surprises for his fans.

I cried when I saw JK's surprise birthday, I bawled when Hobi saw his parents' video for his birthday, I teared up when they read their letters.

It was..  cathartic. I found myself pulling back, away from the edge. It was a release. 

They made me happy. They make me happy. They are not just an obsession. (Fuck you, 'supposedly close friend'!) 

Not ashamed to say they saved me. 

Much love, BTS - a proud fanboy.","Oh I know the feeling. I’m 24 years old and my friends and family think that I’m far too old to be fangirling over a group of guys I don’t know and that it’s ‘a phase’ (*eyeroll*).

LOL, the legendary jacket flip. I’m the exact same. They can have me grinning from ear to ear, to belly laughing, to being an emotional wreck in minutes. We feel their feelings and emotions through their videos.

You are holding a cup of coffee when someone comes along and bumps into you or shakes your arm, making you spill your coffee everywhere.

Why did you spill the coffee?

“Well because someone bumped into me, of course!”

Wrong answer.

You spilled the coffee because there was coffee in your cup. Had there been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea.

\*Whatever is inside the cup, is what will spill out.\*

Therefore, when life comes along and shakes you (which WILL happen), whatever is inside you will come out. It’s easy to fake it, until you get rattled.

\*So we have to ask ourselves… “what’s in my cup?”

When life gets tough, what spills over?

791,1.0,"Last week, my girlfriend left me and also revealed that she has been lying to me in a really serious way since we started our relationship over a year ago. She told me that she has another boyfriend, who she had been seeing for three years when she met me. They are engaged to be married, but he gave her an ultimatum to tell me about him (he has known about me for some time apparently) and finish things.

I'm surprisingly calm, considering the circumstances. I have had a few emotional moments, but nothing I think was inappropriate.

120,1.0,"The funny thing was he kept rejecting me out of fear of rejection. First as a romantic potential, to being downgraded as a friend, to a stranger. There was no way I could help his low self esteem. It’s only something he can fix. All it took was disappointing me once and he lost all confidence in us. It was very sad. He managed to reach out before, but this time...I’m not so sure. Communication has been on his terms. Our relationship has been on his terms. I had no choice except to accept things are they are (deteriorating) or walk away. He’s made decisions for us each step of the way, with no consideration for me. He’s probably on his next fix to distract from himself. That’s all I ever was, or at least how I feel now. It’s like I never existed or mattered the instant he stopped feeling validation from me.

I unfriended him but I didn’t block him. I just didn’t want to be tempted to look at his Facebook anymore. It’ll just hurt to know he’s able to interact with others but not me. I had to end things for my own health. I felt it was very abusive the way he treated me by pushing me away. He was never mean to me ever. But the ghosting I felt was cruel and inhumane and I didn’t deserve that. He told me be done more for him than anyone else. But it seems he’d rather invest his energy towards others, towards people who mattered less. It’s like he forgot I am human too and am allowed to be upset or feel sad.

I tried reaching out several times. My own best friend did too behind my back which pissed me off. I didn’t ask her to and when she told me, I was livid. I felt this was between me and him. She was my support system but in no way I felt she had the right. But honestly, I knew she was just looking out for me. She couldn’t take it anymore seeing me so hurt, so I understand. She meant to be kind to him too but he probably ignored her just like he did with me.

I sent him a card with a hand drawn “picture” of us. I have a real photo of us, a selfie, but I never shared it with him. And we shared a moment we didn’t take a photo of, so I drew it instead to capture that memory. I left an open ended message hoping it’d be a nice memory to think of when he needs some lightness.

If Im honest, part of the reason why I quit was because his loud silence through all my efforts made me feel like a weirdo. I don’t want to be seen as obsessive for trying. I always believe it’s not worth it trying so much if someone lets you feel so worthless. It’s unkind. It’s unusually cruel. Honestly, I’m worth more than that. I value him as a person but I also value myself too.

I’ll never know why he did this. I wish I knew so I can heal. But it’s like having a shrapnel embedded in you and any wrong movement can just trigger the pain or deepen it. Ive been walking around with shrapnel in me for half a year now. I’m just very sad and hurt and go to bed crying every night, not knowing what happened. Maybe I never will.

I think you telling your friends bye was a greater kindness than you’d know. Because at least you gave them closure in a way. My health has been wrecked and I’m in therapy because of the pain this caused.

129,1.0,I GOT DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND I CAN BARELY MOVE ANYMORE FUCK THIS EARTH,"Very sorry to hear that. I have a good idea of what you must be feeling. I got diagnosed with extremely aggressive symmetrical rheumatoid arthritis when I was 22. Basically, both my shoulders went to hell, then all the joints in both hands, then both elbows, both knees, everything in both feet, bit by bit. I literally couldn't move out of bed some days. Got put on oral drugs but had to go off cuz they trashed my liver. Went on Humira, which worked great but was 35k a year to buy. Thankfully I qualified for a program through the state to get it for free. After 2 years (and pain free after the first year) on Humira, I had to go off because it was damaging my organs as well. At this point I was 25, and I went off the Humira and my doc said we would wait and see how bad the pain and swelling got when completely off my meds to see what we would try next.

The strange thing is that the pain and swelling never did come back. My arthritis has been in remission for 8 years now and the only thing my doc could think was that it was a rare form of late onset juvenile arthritis. But really no one can be sure.

I don't want to instill any false hope, but I also want to tell you it's not all darkness and despair either. I was in a bad place for a long time from all the pain and barely being able to move. Being 22 and not being able to even wipe myself some days is not something I will ever forget, but for some reason I got lucky and my body recovered. I hope you will find a way to manage your symptoms so you can live your life normally.

The strange thing is that the pain and swelling never did come back. My arthritis has been in remission for 8 years now and the only thing my doc could think was that it was a rare form of late onset juvenile arthritis. But really no one can be sure.

I don't want to instill any false hope, but I also want to tell you it's not all darkness and despair either. I was in a bad place for a long time from all the pain and barely being able to move. Being 22 and not being able to even wipe myself some days is not something I will ever forget, but for some reason I got lucky and my body recovered. I hope you will find a way to manage your symptoms so you can live your life normally. I will doubly hope that you make a full recovery. </listener>"

647,2.0,"Gonna be real here...worst week of my life, haha. 

Gonna keep it relatively short because I don't want to bother anyone (hypocritical because I'm making the post to begin with), but I just broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years like...a few days ago. 

We had known she was moving to the states for months now, but we tried to pretend it wasn't happening. In retrospect, maybe should have broke it off earlier... 

The reason we broke up wasn't because we don't like each other (quite the contrary! I still keep in touch) but because we both know each other well enough to know that we just wouldn't want to do long distance. 

I feel...i dunno, like my heart is eating itself alive? Really shitty I guess. Look, my life is good. I get good grades, I have lots of friends, I play sports and people here I think like me too! I understand that I'm coming off as a massive jackass to some of you, probably. ""Oh, woe is me! I amicably broke up with my girlfriend!"" 

Maybe I don't even have the right to feel bad but genuinely I feel absolutely disgusting. I fucking miss her. It's just... I  feel sorta empty I guess. Like I lost part of my life. Reason I'm even telling you guys this is because while I tend to keep most of my real life to myself, this is just something that is too much for me to bottle up I think. I dunno.

Ah well, I'm young. Probably just being a over reacting asshole, who probably doesn't have the right to feel this bad, and I'm really sorry if this post comes off as me being a total asshole. Im sorry. I didn't mean to if it came off that way. 

Oh, and I stubbed my toe this morning, so that's just peachy. Hope you all had a good week though!","oiy... been there bro. broke up with my gf of 5 years this past september and some days i wake up like ""why did i even wake up today"" lol. its a gut wrenching feeling and it sucks. time helps though, as cliche as that sounds.

i will tell you somethin though, it IS good that you arent trying the long distance thing. i might be a little pessimistic but long distance is insane and sucks a huge amount of ass. i did 70 miles long distance for like a year and it was a *nightmare*. cant even imagine a different country.

dunno why she moved, but it sounds like you guys are on good terms so you never know, you could always reconnect somewhere down the road maybe. some time flying solo could be good for you.

the heart eating itself feeling will go away slowly. buncha random things are gonna remind you of her and it'll come back, but gradually its less frequent. eventually you'll go an entire day and realize you didnt really think about her at all. well thats my experience with it anyways

But I can't fix that, so I focus my energy on other areas of my life. I have been meaning to give more thought to my own relationship with appearance and society's relationship with appearance and inspect those overlaps. A lot of my life epiphanies and major lifestyle changes have been on the heels of a tragedy in my life, because my MO is to slow down and inspect myself when something like this strikes.

I do really like myself way more as a person than the way I look, which I'm sort of indifferent to without makeup and inclined to like with makeup. I've received nice feedback about both versions. Anyway, I would identify strongly as a confident person, on a normal day.

I held my mother as she died.


My older brother didn't have consent to let my mother off life support. He wouldn't tell me to do it. 


I had firm beliefs not to let her off life support. I joked with her while she was alive that I'd keep her alive with her head in a jar.


I had to give them the ok, under pressure from family to let her die.


I held as her heart stopped beating. 


She was my god. She grew blind the last three years of her life. I fed her, her every meal. I bathed her. I sought her every want. The universe died with her. This isn't my world.

","I'm so sorry you had to go through that, and I'm so sorry this experience has made all this past pain resurface with it. It's okay to grieve for your mother, the puppy, lost friends and family, the injustices of the world, everything at once. It's hard not to once you get going, honestly. But make sure to grieve, let yourself feel that pain so that it may pass, because I promise you it will lessen in time. Your mother was such a bright light for you that she's burning into you in this time of crisis, but you're still too sad from her passing to feel comfort from her presence.

Her memories, her love and the lessons she raised you with will live with you for eternity - but only if you move past this rage and anger you're holding on to in your grief. Until then, her memory will only bring you pain, when her legacy deserves to be remembered with so much more than that. You have to let yourself accept that this is the new world you're in, without her, even though it hurts. You're shutting out that love and light she's trying to guide you with, because your vision is too darkened by the pain. You must learn to live with it, accept it as part of you, and turn it into something beautiful your mother would be proud of. Your love of your father through all of this shows me you're capable of anything, your potential is limitless. She would want to see you succeed and find joy after her passing, and how do we know she's truly gone from this plane after consciousness leaves the body?

I found out Friday my mom has cancer - multiple myeloma - and it feels like all self control has flown out the window.

I’ve finally gotten to my lowest weight in 5 years the day I found out and now I’m eating beyond maintenance and I’m so frustrated with myself.

The sad/awful thing is that she’s begging everyone around her to keep their health so multiple crises don’t arise at once, and I’m on track to eating my way back to 200lbs.  

This is making me realized I have a woeful lack of coping skills beyond stress eating/binging.","Hey, my dad was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multiple Myeloma 16 years ago. He found out when he broke his back while changing a car tire. He’s physically in awful shape because of his back injuries (his spine also compressed on itself), but that was more so due to his lack of motivation to do physical therapy when he should have. Other than that, the cancer is in remission and has been for a while! I believe his treatment includes Thalidomide and it appears to do a GREAT job. 

If your mom has physical injuries from the cancer (it can weaken bone marrow leading to breaks and fractures), encourage her to work through it and get back on her feet ASAP. I swear my dad would be a different person if he had just done PT and not let himself deteriorate. 

Try different chemotherapy treatments until she finds what works best for her - they have come leaps and bounds with multiple myeloma and it is not a death sentence. She sounds like a strong woman if she’s concerned about the people around her more than herself. If my dad can win at this bitch of a cancer for so long, I know she can too.  

And please give yourself a break. Try to get back on track, but cancer is a horrible and scary thing and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for feeling weak at such a difficult time. It’s still new.

I’ve finally gotten to my lowest weight in 5 years the day I found out and now I’m eating beyond maintenance and I’m so frustrated with myself.

The sad/awful thing is that she’s begging everyone around her to keep their health so multiple crises don’t arise at once, and I’m on track to eating my way back to 200lbs.  

This is making me realized I have a woeful lack of coping skills beyond stress eating/binging. </speaker> <listener> Hey, my dad was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multiple Myeloma 16 years ago. He found out when he broke his back while changing a car tire. He’s physically in awful shape because of his back injuries (his spine also compressed on itself), but that was more so due to his lack of motivation to do physical therapy when he should have. Other than that, the cancer is in remission and has been for a while! I believe his treatment includes Thalidomide and it appears to do a GREAT job. 

If your mom has physical injuries from the cancer (it can weaken bone marrow leading to breaks and fractures), encourage her to work through it and get back on her feet ASAP. I swear my dad would be a different person if he had just done PT and not let himself deteriorate. 

Try different chemotherapy treatments until she finds what works best for her - they have come leaps and bounds with multiple myeloma and it is not a death sentence. She sounds like a strong woman if she’s concerned about the people around her more than herself. If my dad can win at this bitch of a cancer for so long, I know she can too.  

And please give yourself a break. Try to get back on track, but cancer is a horrible and scary thing and you shouldn’t beat yourself up for feeling weak at such a difficult time. It’s still new. Let yourself process for a few days. ❤️❤️❤️ </listener>"

There is a very real potential that in 30 years her, or one of her sisters may cop a similar fate.
I'm OK with the fact I had my face buried in it while working under the house and I'll be 60+ before anything major starts, but thinking about it happening to my wife or kids and having seen two close family friends die from it, all but consumes me when I let it.","Shit man, I’m so sorry to hear that. 

The thing that really shits me is even back in the 40’s there was a doc in Wittenoom saying that is was a bad idea, but of course big mining got their own way. And even knowing THAT, it was still used in the ACT in the 60s? And now with what’s going on, it’s like the past 80 years of what’s happened here in Australia has been completely disregarded. 

Hopefully with the fact that mesothelioma is taken seriously here, things may advance medically that will hopefully at least provide some relief, if not a total cure. 

Thinking of you and your fam, I really hope you all will be ok 🤞

I try to put it in twice but steam is telling me it's wrong and that I'm logged in somewhere else. Then it has me log into Steam entirely, because im logged in somewhere else.

My original friend in the chat went offline right after that whole situation happened and hasn't been online since. I know I'm an idiot and I should've seen the signs, but hindsight is 20/20.

You probably had some really valuable or sentimental things on your account, so I'm sorry about that.

For some people they lose their rocket league items, others it's their identity getting stolen, bank account drained, or all of their email/data being taken hostage.

Some common warning signs/reasons to be skeptical:

- If someone asks for any passwords or personal information 

- If someone says you won something you never signed up for

- If they ask you to do something urgently or quickly, with the threat of some sort of dire consequence if you don't do it (i.e. claim in 15 mins or your Draco's will go to someone else)

- If the website you are linked to is not the official website of the organization/company/whatever.

- It's a unexpected communication from someone you don't know.

Shit that's depressing.

I am a low level factory worker and since August of last year we have worked Monday through Saturday every week except the first of the month where we got that first Saturday off. Seeing as how I work 2nd shift we are required to pick up whatever slack is left, meaning that more often than not we are staying 2-4 hours over on the last day of the week.

This ""crunch"" is really putting a strain on our relationship since i dont get to spend much time with her when she needs it.

So last year in January my girlfriend broke up with me. I've also had to put down about 6 pets in my life. I can't imagine the combined stress of those two situations.

At some point, and this might take months, you'll find yourself again. Something will make you laugh and for a brief second you'll forget the pain. You'll start seeking more things that make you feel good again, and before you know it you'll feel new again. Not perfect, but no longer broken.

For me, that actually led to me meeting someone new.

It sucks that you're experiencing a rough time. Sorry to hear about everything that you're currently going through.

If you need to talk it through with someone, definitely feel free to send me a PM. I know that sometimes it may feel like you're the only one on earth who's in the battle, and I know that sometimes we don't want to hear that others are going through (or have gone through) similar situations) because it can make us feel like we're either downgrading your demons or making you believe like you're not as strong as you should be, but please know that's not the case. A lot of us are there with you, passing by or permanent residents. You're strong for having the ability to reach out, even if it's just to strangers on Reddit.

I totally understand how the Leafs can be the ultimate escape in your normal, everyday life, but it's especially heightened in times like these. The community of hockey, the thrill of each play, the idea of being a part of something special, the feeling of having something to look forward too and then talking about it here - it makes a world of difference.

The next game is just around the corner, and the next one is only a couple days after that. Before then, and in-between games, try to give yourself something to look forward to or get semi-excited about (even if it just watching ""Ellen"" or the news at 6 or a movie from 8-10). In my experience, it helps a lot. Also, if you can, a 10-20 minute walk can do a world of good (around the block, going to Tim Hortons, etc. - it helps).

I had my cat for 12 years, also... Or, I should say, that's how long she lived and was my friend. From age 7 to age 19. I watched her being born, but I couldn't handle watching her die... She was very sick and weak and in pain and had to be euthanized. My dad offered to take her, and I didn't go. I told you, I have a mental block about crying. I instead went to play paintball (aggressive). I cried later, a lot. That's just another time I remember wanting to be able to cry right away. Aggression (hitting, kicking, screaming, etc) does release some energy, but I feel like tears are what's underneath all that anyway. I know I don't feel really better until I have a good cry.

Cats live in the moment, so I can guarantee you that he never in his life had a regret, or looked back on a time he didn't get his way. Try to focus on all the joy you two had together, instead.

If it helps, maybe write down a favorite story about him. A funny personality quirk of his, or the story of how you adopted him, or something silly he did once.

Had I only known he was so sick... </speaker> <listener> It's hard when you're grieving, but don't let yourself think that way. Cats live in the moment, so I can guarantee you that he never in his life had a regret, or looked back on a time he didn't get his way. Try to focus on all the joy you two had together, instead.

If it helps, maybe write down a favorite story about him. A funny personality quirk of his, or the story of how you adopted him, or something silly he did once.

834,4.0,"Sorry to bring Wednesday's free talk down, but I just need somewhere to vent. My ex died Sunday morning in a horrible car accident. We were together for 11 years and in each other's lives for about 13. We got together I was 16 and he was 17 and broke up around 2 years ago; it was the best and worst relationship of my life. There are like a thousand layers to our story, most of which baffled so many people, but we just had this bond. The highs were unmatched. I can't explain it. He was abusive and a chronic cheater. And when we broke up, it was something that the universe was basically forcing upon me, because I kept going back and trying to fix him and us. 

We'd recently reconnected in Dec while he was undergoing surgery. It had taken me almost all those 2 years to be a semblance of myself again after our breakup; I moved back to NYC away from him, and created an entirely new life for myself. It was refreshing that I'd felt like I'd moved on and wasn't interested in him romantically, but would always love him as the one person who probably knew me better than anyone in the world. He was dealing with a lot because he didn't process our breakup at the time and he generally wasn't happy with himself and filled that hole with women and alcohol and drugs; when he found himself single again, he was suddenly flailing and just unable to live with himself. 

We slipped back into that routine where he'd be calling me when he needed a therapist or someone to understand him, and I relented because I knew him so well. That lead to him professing his love to me over and over, and me gently turning him down because I just couldn't put myself through that again, despite how much I loved him. Whether it was because he loved me or needed someone familiar to fill the emptiness, or a mix of both, I'll never quite know ... but it had gotten to be strenuous for me, just having to either defend myself for not being there for him or just having to see how sad he was. I knew it wasn't my place or my fault, but I still felt responsible. 

I stopped responding to him about a week ago because it was affecting my health, and I got the call Sunday afternoon from his mom. I am devastated, mostly numb. It hits me in waves. I didn't post publicly about it until yesterday night and then scores of people started contacting me. I've only been responding to my family and his family and our closest friends. I feel overwhelming amount of guilt because I can't respond to these people who love me and just want to know how I am, and keep calling, but I'm just not there. 

Has anyone ever dealt with grief that's not quite your grief to own? It's difficult because we hadn't been together in 2 years, hadn't seen each other in 2 years, but shared almost half our life together and were on good terms before he died. I don't know how to handle the people who want to help but I just can't be there right now or even respond to most of them because it's just so much, to be present and to be a person. I just kind of needed an ""anonymous"" forum to vomit these thoughts out. Thanks for listening, guys","Damn, I'm really sorry to hear this. That is a terrible situation any way you cut it.

I HAVE had similar withdrawals to your experience in the past when I was using extracts. To combat that I went from the strong gold reserve to the slightly weaker gold elephas mixed with super enhanced  indo. Then I removed the gold elephas and switched to the super enhanced indo mixed with enhanced maeng da. Then enhanced maeng da mixed with plain Bali leaf. Then just the plain leaf. I kept gradually stepping down and it worked pretty well. There would be a day or two of lethargy and depressed mood when I made a switch, but then I would feel good and in a positive mood that I had accomplished another goal in my step down process. </listener>"

307,1.0,"I can only (mostly) speak anecdotally, but maybe I can shed some light on the ""why"" so that you can get it. It also really depends on where you live.

For me, I live in what has traditionally been one of the most violent cities in the country, and at one point held the #1 title for violent crime.

When I was 5 years old, my mother was stabbed 14 times in a purse robbery by a random dude on the street. I watched her die in the hospital later that morning, and my little 5 year old brain could barely even comprehend what was happening.

Over the years, I've been on the receiving end of multiple acts of violent crime. I've had guns and knives pulled on me. I've actually been stabbed. I've been robbed. I've been jumped for no reason.

It's a tough decision to make, to either retain a victim mentality, and hope the police will do a better job to protect you, or to take your life into your own hands and decide ""enough is enough"" and start being responsible for your own safety, especially when you live in a country where even the cops are killing innocent people, and even if they're good cops, it can take them too long to reach you in an emergency. When seconds matter, help is only minutes way, as they say.

So, it's definitely a cultural thing. I would love to feel safe without a weapon, but I don't. Carrying a gun isn't a guarantee that I'll be safe, but it at least gives me a chance at survival where one might not otherwise exist.

Stories like mine are the reason people get so defensive over their gun rights.

Most people go through tough times where they are depressed, and possibly suicidal. Hell, I myself went through a period like that not too many years ago. Personally my strategy to get my mind off of struggles was to focus on making myself a better person. I started picking up hobbies that I thought I would enjoy or that I wanted to get better at so that in 20 years I can be really good at something. I started to push myself out of my comfort zone in order to meet new people and make new friends. I started pretending to be confident in the hopes that I would fake it until I could be confident for real (it worked much better than I thought it would). I changed the way o dressed, and I embraced my quirkiness. Basically I started investing in myself while also reinventing myself in the hopes that I could focus everything new I was doing and forget about everything that was bothering me. 

All this helped, but it didn't really do away with my sadness nor my problems. But what it did do was buy me time - the one thing that really helped. Every second spent on a hobby, on making friends, on hanging out with said friends was a second that I could temporarily forget about my problems. Of course it didn't deal with the root of the problem itself, but thanks to all of those things, I had something to hold on to - at least for a little bit - enough to endure until my problems were resolved or forgotten about.

687,1.0,"Man this is disappointing. I don't know much about politics but I have been watching this bill. 

I'm 23 and have been in pain every day for almost 10 years. It's really fucked up my life. The doctors haven't been able to diagnose or treat my pain, and I'm poor af because I can't work. I have to live off the sickness benefit which we already know is a joke these days. 

They all throw drugs at me, tramadol, codeine, my trips to hospital have involved up to 4 shots of fentanyl at a time. I take sleeping tablets which make me feel high as hell and NOT in a good way. I take 1200mg of gabapentin a day. I also take paracetamol and ibuprofen on top of all this. This is the only way I can have any hope of not suffering through every day of my life, but even then I've given up on feeling ""normal"". All these drugs make me nauseous obviously, but the anti nausea drugs they give me don't work. It's almost funny how many damn drugs they'll throw at me just to keep me ""sane"". Speaking of sane, I'm so sick and tired of living like this, so much so that I recently banged my head against the wall and gave myself a bad concussion. The health services have failed me over and over again. The mental health services are... Non existent for me. 

I first started using marijuana when I was 18 and suffering from withdrawals after becoming physically addicted to a heavy pain killer. 

It took away my nausea, 100%. Cured headaches. Helped me sleep better than any pill. It didn't cure my pain (where I live we don't get to chose what weed we get so I couldn't get the types of strains that help with pain) but it kept me calm, relaxed and happy. I was able to get nicely distracted from the pain and actually enjoy stuff for once. My painful episodes used to leave me feeling severely depressed, anxious, panicked. But weed changed all that. I was so elated to find something that worked, that didn't give me side effects or fuck with my body. 

But it's illegal and hard to find here. I haven't been able to get any for almost a year now and I have stopped trying. I'm so tired. I'm back on all the pharmaceutical drugs and I hate it so much but I don't have a choice. They mess with my digestion, my energy levels, my ability to absorb nutrients from my food. My gut is absolutely fucked. I eat really well, I move when I can, I have hobbies and I'm trying everything I can. But I'm still very sick. I'm in so much pain, day in and day out. 

I would love to come off all these pharma drugs. I would LOVE to not be a criminal. I would love to be able to access the right type of weed, grown by a trustworthy source. And have it be affordable. This result today is discouraging but I am still glad we're talking about it, and trying. I'm in bad shape but I know others have it much worse off than I do, and I'd love them to get the medicine they need too. This country would be better off. 

Take the power away from the gangs, get us sick folk some safe marijuana so we can just put down the fucking pill bottles, chill out with a bong, eat our dinner and have a good nights sleep. God knows we fucking deserve it.","Man, until you mentioned the specific drugs you were on, I thought I found my brother's account. Exactly the same situation. It took him much longer to find marijuana as a way to kill the symptoms of withdrawals (from the prescribed fentanyl/oxy), but his quality of life is so much better for it. I am glad parliament is considering medicinal marijuana for terminal illness, but chronic pain is a much more prevalent condition and so much suffering could be prevented that legislation was made a little broader.

This problem has been made so much worse in the last couple of years by the restrictions placed on GPs and pain clinics regarding opiods - many people on them for chronic pain have to go through Drug and Alcohol Services, who are simply not equipped to deal with treatment chronic pain and generally want to take them off those opiods with no effective withdrawal relief.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> Man this is disappointing.

Take it as a blessing dude. We live in such fast times now and many girls have had bad experiences with ""fuckbois"" that once they hear you haven't slept with any girls; some will see it as more a positive than a negative. 

The best I can say here is to try approach your dates with the thought of hooking up and having sex completely out of the picture, ask alot of questions and listen well. Make them laugh and relax, first dates can be pretty nerve wracking but find a good subject that you both might be comfortable on and get some humour going. After the while if you make past more than 1 date, you should feel a little more comfortable in saying you have never slept with girls.

 When I broke it to the girl I was still a virgin I literally said it in so much confidence that she saw it as a turn on. Something along the lines of ""Yea I'm gonna be honest I don't fuck around with girls feelings and emotions because I see it all too often and it just leaves people hurt"" I then went on to spend 3 years of my life with this girl and we had very amazing sex for that 3 Years. There is hope for you my man, be confident in yourself! Quality over quantity man, I've slept with some beautiful girls on Tinder who weren't very good because chemistry just wasn't there.

733,1.0,"My earliest memory is from when I was 3 years old, about to turn 4. Some policemen showed up at the door to my house, talked to my mom for awhile, and she started screaming and crying. I was confused, since I loved policemen. They're helpful and strong and friendly, right? How could they make my mom cry like that?

They told me the same thing. My father was dead.

I've always wished I could remember anything about his life. I've seen pictures, and I've heard stories about what he was like from the people whose lives he touched, but that never felt like enough. I wanted to remember him in some way personal to me. I was his only child, and everyone tells me how much he loved me, even to this day. That his love could leave that much of a mark on people, but none apparent on me, was something I could never accept easily.

He had gone from his home town in Kouchi prefecture, Japan, to the United States to work at his friend's business. He was a travel agent. Not a glorious or superb position by most measures, though he certainly didn't mistake his work for his life. He was known by the community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man you would trust with your most valuable things. Still, I find it ironic that as I'm preparing to make the same journey he did now that new year's is over, from my grandparents' house back to the city I grew up in, that even as I've been successful in life by any metric, that I could never find whatever part of my soul it was that belonged to him.

Would he have been proud of his daughter? Anyone who has a father would know that the answer is yes, regardless of my material circumstances. But I never had the luxury of hearing this from him. ""Your father would be so proud of you"" stopped feeling good at some point, and began to sting.

I watched Uchouten Kazoku last year. If you're not aware, one of the main themes of the show has to do with the protagonist dealing with his father's death and legacy. Souichirou Shimogamo was a great man. He was respected by his community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man who could save the world. Yasaburou seeks to measure up to him. Yajirou hides his feelings because he lost his completeness. Yaichirou wants to have his own family. Yashirou desires a fun life.

I am these characters. All of them, all parts of me interacting on the screen, finding themselves and helping each other. I had come to terms long ago with the fact that I would never get whatever it was that I was looking for from my father. Uchouten Kazoku showed me something more valuable than that: my father wouldn't even want me to try.

I'm finding my own happiness. I haven't forgotten you, dad.

I watched Uchouten Kazoku last year. If you're not aware, one of the main themes of the show has to do with the protagonist dealing with his father's death and legacy. Souichirou Shimogamo was a great man. He was respected by his community as a friendly, happy, intelligent, caring man -- the kind of man who could save the world. Yasaburou seeks to measure up to him. Yajirou hides his feelings because he lost his completeness. Yaichirou wants to have his own family. Yashirou desires a fun life.

I am these characters. All of them, all parts of me interacting on the screen, finding themselves and helping each other. I had come to terms long ago with the fact that I would never get whatever it was that I was looking for from my father. Uchouten Kazoku showed me something more valuable than that: my father wouldn't even want me to try.

I'm finding my own happiness. I haven't forgotten you, dad.

Yes but the new people I met didn’t know I was doing it out of insecurity so they just thought I was an adventurous guy and were attracted to that.

I ended up meeting so many new people and having more fun than I’d ever had with this girl (fuck you Clare.) I got in great shape and all told had a lot of sex . Did I end up telling half the girls I slept with about how sad I was about my ex? Yes and was it pathetic? Again yes. But I stopped after the first few because I started to genuinely care less. I still do care about her and for the first year after the break up I really cared a lot about her. It’s a long, long journey my friend but you have no choice but to take it. Be happy and know that it’s going to take you somewhere good. I’m living proof and there are millions more with my same story. Love you bud even though I don’t know ya </listener>"
99,1.0,My birthday is tomorrow and my mom died three days ago now. I’m dying of grief.,"I'm so sorry to hear that =( 

Your mom lives on inside of you. All the neurons of your brain have been shaped by her. Your brain is a physical manifestation of the impact she had on the world.

The cliche phrase ""They're not gone, they're alive, in here"" /points to heart"" is true, but they pointed to the wrong organ. The people we love are alive inside of us. They helped mold and shape our brains, our character, the way we are.

I had a friend who died of Pancreatic Cancer, very suddenly. He was a childhood friend, named Andrew. In 5th grade, Andrew convinced me to try a Western Bacon Cheeseburger from Carl's Jr. It's the only thing I've ever ordered after that.

Andrew is gone, but he changed me indefinitely. I love Western Bacon Cheeseburgers and that's directly because of him. Whenever I travel to a state with a Carl's Jr., I go get a Western Bacon Cheeseburger and think of him. 

Your mom has literally shaped you, if there's anything that reminds of your mom, maybe you can take tomorrow or one of your days off to go do something that you love because of her. 

Or just hang out and pretend she's there. You'll seem like a crazy person, but that doesnt matter, because your mom IS there. When we imagine ""What would &lt;so and so&gt; say about that!"", that's the part of them that's still alive. We've interacted with them so much that it's like writing data to a hard drive. Our mom's leave data written all across our brains. To some extent, the people we love have copied their consciousness in to our own brains.

She's still in there, inside of you. She's not gone, it's not just empty memories. Try to take it easy, think of the pleasant memories and reinforce them. Cry a lot, drink, eat, smoke, and keep the memory of your mom alive in your mind.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> My birthday is tomorrow and my mom died three days ago now.

Yeah, when he first died, I continued to have those dreams. That dream was him saying goodbye to me, and he stuck around for a while. I'd dream about him as a young man, full head of black hair (which he never had while I was alive, hah). He'd be standing on the staircase, or sitting in the chair he died in. I'd say in the dream, ""you're here! You're back!"" and he'd just look at me so peacefully. More peaceful than I'd probably ever seen him in life. He stuck around for a while.

no girlfriend no friends my parents treat me like i have no personality .","Bro, truth of the matter is that no one else will ever make you feel complete. If you feel lonely right now, understand that everyone goes through this at some point. The harsh truth is that, I only started to be a focal point in my friend group when people realised that I gave them value. So how do you give people value?

From this if there is anyone that you like,  just take a leap of faith man. Rejection is rough bro. I'm going through something like that right now.

Right now I'm just trying to relax for the night since my back feels super fucked up (been having stomach issues plus bad posture at my desk job) and I am going to try and do something tonight to not be a complete lazy jerk.

From here on out, it will be a tough climb, and all I can offer is nice words and encouragement, but you must get out of this mindset and finally look at yourself and start to change....inside and out. 

Thank you for having the courage to share. As of now I can only offer words of encouragement, but I do hope that one day you will beat this and get better. I also hope the community will help with your struggle.

Even if you don't maintain a 4.50 GPA to continue doing courses in your program, know that school is not a race. We all learn at our own pace. Take time to reflect where you went wrong, and find different ways to approach your course work. I repeated grade twelve, because I was a slower learner than my peers. My teachers didn't even think I'd graduate from high-school, because I was (to them) 'not prepared mentally'. Well, former teachers, you can suck my dick, as I'm now at Schulich.

In my experience, everyone really wants to love and support you in your pregnancy but isn't sure how. Enjoy your MIL, enjoy yourself and don't get caught up in him, you only have a limited time to yourself now. Spend your time organising and doting on yourself. 

As for the morning sickness, you simply can't let yourself stress it. It's awful (I'm 22wk and still puke at 0630 everyday) but it will settle. For me, I can't let myself get anywhere near hungry.

856,1.0,"Thanks for your reply. The breakup happened more in the aftermath of this that I didn't go into in my post. I can see why you think it's unfair so I'll go ahead and explain it. Since we had gotten engaged things had been difficult, especially around planning this wedding. Last year I moved 3,000 miles to be with him and recently started a new job. In the meantime, I was working on planning our wedding and I did about 99 percent of the work. His family had a lot of demands which I accommodated- however, anything I considered saying 'no' to, he would yell and scream at me. This got worse and worse as time went by, to the point where at times he became nonverbal and was just screaming. He would talk or interrupt me talking and then tell me he was too stressed out and that the 'discussion was over' and then blame me for his yelling and screaming. This was bad enough that I requested professional counseling. After seeing this scene that happened at Church, I now realize that he was probably EXTREMELY stressed out by the prospect of saying 'no' to these people about anything for fear that they would do something like this. His typical method of dealing with his family is to just say 'yes' to what they want so that he doesn't have to deal with their drama. His stepmother also caused issues by spreading rumors about me (saying things like how could my family let me leave home and move away and that meant I wasn't a chaste girl, asking invasive questions about my parents' divorce that happened 25 years ago, talking about my engagement ring and its cost). His dad was frequently in contact with my father who very kindly, and repeatedly, asked that they take a step back because they were causing me a lot of stress in what should be a fun process. About 2 weeks before this happened my dad expressed concern that they might do something at my bridal shower and basically told me I didn't have to get married if I don't want to because he has a lot of concerns about this family and the way they were treating me and their son. 

After the event in the main post happened, we went to see the priest of my family's Orthodox church (our officiant), who spent almost four hours talking us through everything. He told my fiancé that what his father and family did at my bridal shower was extremely inappropriate and that their behavior over the wedding planning process (which I didn't get into in my post as either for the sake of length) had been disrespectful and that the right thing to do would be to have his family mend fences with me. He also suggested counseling to work on communication. He told me with the Church people who acted that way in the bridal shower what they did was wrong as well but if my fiancé and his family can have a change of heart then he thinks they will also because they were told a one sided story, and if they don't it's on them. 

My fiancé went back to his family to talk to them about this and each and every one of them denied that their actions were wrong whatsoever and refused to apologize to him or me for their behavior in publicly humiliating us both at my bridal shower, and persistently harassing me over 10 months of wedding planning. [When I say harassing, I mean constant texts and phonecalls to both of us, they wanted to decide EVERYTHING from the guest list, who would officiate, what languages the service would be in, and who would escort MY MOTHER down the aisle. The vast majority of the stuff that they asked for, they got. Everything I picked was 'too expensive' even though my family was paying for those things. Constantly wanting to add more people to the guest list even though we almost had 400 people and starting to say things like ""well your brother's wedding had empty seats so if some extra/uninvited people show up that should be fine"" and ""we should set some empty tables just in case.""]

So he came back to me and basically said, I was wrong for ""letting myself"" have a panic attack and being late, that yes they did something wrong but that I 'overreacted', that I should have given into all of his family's demands because it's 'just a wedding' and they 'need to control' the wedding because weddings are important in their culture, and that he is a part of his family no matter how they behave and will not ask them for any more apologies or keep talking to them about this because they 'don't agree' that what they did was wrong. He said 'they agree' about putting the wedding on pause so that 'the next time around we can all come to the table and they can tell me what we need to do.' He begged me to just let them control this one day so that we can get married and I said it's not about the wedding it's about this behavior and the fact that I cannot deal with it for the rest of my life, especially with someone who will not empathize with me or emotionally support me. Furthermore, I don't believe it would stop at the wedding. The next thing will be his father 'needs to decide' our baby's name or what kind of house we should buy and I'll be berated until I say yes. We continued to discuss this over a period of a couple weeks and had another counseling session with the priest who did our premarital counseling. My fiancé also refused to listen to the advice we were given there which is that he needs to have some boundaries with his family, not allow his spouse to be humiliated in public, and be empathetic to my feelings rather than constantly putting me down while excusing what his relatives do. Instead, in the past few weeks, I was called every name in the book including ones beginning with C, MF, B, etc. Obviously at that point I was not willing to move forward so I went and asked my brand new boss to help me transfer my job I just started to where my nearest family members live, 2,500 miles away from here. Obviously this is a lot of info but I wanted to answer your question, this just doesn't really fit with the theme of the original post so I didn't include it.","L,

62,1.5,"TW: I am currently going through a miscarriage. It is surreal.

I posted here a few weeks ago about having a ton of anxiety in early pregnancy. And now it's like...oh, hey, the worst possible thing is happening. But I'm still here, I'm getting through it, and I just have to deal with it.

I go back and forth between utter sadness, tears, etc to a more logical ""well, it wasn't viable, it's just biology, my body reacted the right way and we can absolutely try again."" We got pregnant the first month we tried and we kept thinking it was too good to be true.

If anyone has a story of getting pregnant after a MC, please share it. I want to feel hopeful. Also, I need to unsubscribe from a billion ""your baby is the size of a blueberry"" emails now. Ugh.

Edited to add: oh my god, thank you all so much for your kind words, stories, and support. This sounds silly but this community has made a horrible day so much better. It's such a relief to know that others understand what I'm feeling so perfectly, and have found joy on the other side. You are all the best.","Oh my heart is breaking for you.  I just want to give you a hug.  Grief is a funny thing and you feel like you are OK one minute and then the next minute you are on the floor unable to move.  I had a miscarriage in March of 2015.  It was my first pregnancy and I had no idea how common they were.  I got pregnant again 6 months later.  My daughter is 18 months old now and a joy and a miracle in my life.  It did help me to know so many of my friends and family members had also had miscarriages and had gone on to have healthy pregnancies.  That is also SO common.  Having a baby after a miscarriage did help tremendously with my grief.  I know that is not the case for all.  However, it took a lot of time.  My second pregnancy was filled with anxiety and I never felt truly like I was going to really have a child until she was literally in my arms.  I had to process a lot of negative emotions about that miscarriage taking the joy of pregnancy away from me.  But, here we are almost 3 years later and our life is beautiful and blessed.

Be kind to yourself through your grief.  Whatever emotions come up are OK and normal.  And if I may offer one piece of unsolicited advice, cling to your husband in your grief rather then turning away.

73,1.0,I think definitely cultural. My sister was molested by a scoutmaster of mine who I trusted as a father figure. My sister has since quite literally gone insane and has schizophrenic episodes (which i believe stem from the trauma) My mom has been married three times.

I just want to share I also had a hard time on my mission. I never had panic attacks until my mission. I am so much happier now that I am home. I’m grateful for the experience but some of the physical things we were asked to do - sleep on floors, do transfers / travel to zone conference overnight and get up early and work the next day put me to my absolute limits. And all was this attitude of “if you have faith the Lord will help you bear it.” You also have to take care of yourself but the judgment gave me huge anxiety.
You also say that you are early 20s. These are the crucial years of your life.

It is disgusting that your scout leader abused your sister and NO ONE DID ANYTHING ABOUT IT. That man should be disfellowshipped, if not excommunicated, for a long time. It sounds like he continues to be a predator. You know your parents did the wrong thing in handling it and your situation on your mission. Are they really trying to follow Christ? Or are they just worried about appearances?

I have struggled too to read the scriptures and pray, especially after my mission. I went a whole year where I barley read my scriptures and went to church maybe half the time. But I still prayed and had spiritual experiences as I asked for help and tried to do what I could.

I hope you don’t give up OP. My testimony and relationship with God are the most beautiful things in my life and a constant source of strength.

 </speaker> <listener> Not having work can be so damn soul-destroying.  Try, please try, to be good to yourself and not blame yourself for the situation you're in.  That only makes things worse.  Keep reminding yourself that there are those who are competing with you for the crumbs out there who don't waste their time and energy on getting down on themselves.  Keep reminding yourself that you can only get through this with *you* on your side.  I know that sounds trite but it's true.

There are so many people struggling with work issues.  40% of people in the US have only $400 in the bank.  But there *must* be more to life than your professional life or how much money you have.  Please don't despair. </listener>"

290,1.0,"I resonate with that. My sister also has DS. Let me tell you what happened to us:

It drove my mother to commit suicide last year. It completely ruined my family (my parents divorced and subsequently my mother became very depressed, my father became a drunk and my other sister left and is no longer in contact with us because she thinks my parent neglected her because of my DS sister).

 Now that my mom is dead I have to take care of my sister (my father doesn't give a shit so I have guardianship). I have to admit that I'm totally burnt out and I'm starting to hate my sister. I can’t help being frustrated and bitter. I know it's not her fault (she didn't choose to be born like that) and I feel bad for feeling that way. I'm stuck and will never be able to have a normal life or just be free. I’m 25 and I have literally no future. I just can't do it anymore and every time I look at my sister I resent her for destroying my future. 

She’s not that high-functioning (she’s mentally around 7-8 yr old) so she goes to a Day Program for people like her. However when she comes home in the evening, I start to get frustrated because I wish I could have a night on my own, just relaxing and not thinking about what’s for supper, her medications, laundry etc….
As a result, I barely talk to her except when I ask her to do something. I can’t really connect with her, she only likes childish things and she asks the same questions again and again. 

I don’t know how to deal with all the guilt, the hate, the sorrow, the bitterness and the dark ideas I have. I even considered killing my sister and then myself to end it all but I know would not be very unfair to her. I’m so envious of my friends who are now starting families or go on vacation while I can’t do all of these things. I feel like a prisoner until she passes away (and ironically I hope she won’t outlive me as the standard of care in my country is not good for people with disabilities).

The messages were from late 2015 &amp; early 2016 where they were both talking about how they couldn’t sleep because they were thinking about each other.

He was also 6 years older than me and single handedly ripped my mothers sanity to the point of mental collapse. He’s threatened violence on us before and gotten angry because we didn’t do enough for him. He blames me, my father, my mother, everyone other than taking responsibility for his own actions. My father, the most godly man I know still tries to help him. He and I have paid money we didn’t have at the time for treatment.

I’ve pleaded. I’ve bribed. I’ve begged. I’ve I’ve yelled. Nothing works. I’ve taken council from hardened reformed criminals who have taken him in and tried to get him on the right path. I’ve been told by those same people that it’s a lost cause. 

He started using when he was 16. He’s an alcoholic. When he gets out of his 2-3 years stents he does in county he’s clean but usually gets right back to it as soon as he’s out.

 His friend that he used to run with “grew out of it” at least that’s what they tell me when they see me and get updates from me about him. 

It’s so easy to hide behind idealism but reality is often very different. Don’t tell me they are a product of their environments or how their families treat them. Let me ask you a question, what about their families? The beauty of it is, he thinks he’s entitled to something. He blames us. He blames the police. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. It might be harsh but the truth is harsh. Some people aren’t worth saving. I’m not saying get rid of them but we don’t have to save them. It’s not a popular notion but yes I value some people over others. The person whose trying to actually work to better themselves rather than the moocher. I didn’t learn his from a blog or at some political rally I learned this from my own experiences.

My attitude is just fine. It’s this assumptive bleeding heart attitude that needs to be rethought. Never before has there been so much arrogant entitlement as there is now. If someone can snort cocaine and still work an assembly line then more power to them, I’ll agree with 100% that the government needs to leave that said coke head assembly line worker alone, but you are wrong to ask society to pay for the moochers, like my brother.","And here you express the honest heart of the matter that so many libertarians are disingenuous about: you don’t want to help certain people.

The argument is always “oh if we cut taxes and didn’t force people to support these social programs, they’d donate of their own free will and everything would be fine”.

As you demonstrate, they would not, and many people deemed “undeserving” would lose the safety net that is keeping them alive.

What will happen to your brother, and others like him, if nobody will help them? Say it out loud, and ask yourself if that’s really something you’re proud of advocating for.",1,1.0,1.0,"<speaker> Nope I’m not buying that. He and I are from the same family, had all of the same opportunities, lived in the same house, drank the same water, everything. He was also 6 years older than me and single handedly ripped my mothers sanity to the point of mental collapse. He’s threatened violence on us before and gotten angry because we didn’t do enough for him. He blames me, my father, my mother, everyone other than taking responsibility for his own actions. My father, the most godly man I know still tries to help him. He and I have paid money we didn’t have at the time for treatment. We used to get him jobs but I will no longer vouch for him as I will no longer risk my reputation because he never stay. His last job he stole the work truck, drove it 200 miles and just left it on the side of the road. I have openly wept in a public restaurant because I was having to feed my older brother, someone I’d admired at one time. I’ve begged him to like a pathetic child to get his act together. I’ve pleaded. I’ve bribed. I’ve begged. I’ve I’ve yelled. Nothing works. I’ve taken council from hardened reformed criminals who have taken him in and tried to get him on the right path. I’ve been told by those same people that it’s a lost cause. 

He started using when he was 16. He’s an alcoholic. When he gets out of his 2-3 years stents he does in county he’s clean but usually gets right back to it as soon as he’s out.

 His friend that he used to run with “grew out of it” at least that’s what they tell me when they see me and get updates from me about him. 

It’s so easy to hide behind idealism but reality is often very different. Don’t tell me they are a product of their environments or how their families treat them. Let me ask you a question, what about their families? The beauty of it is, he thinks he’s entitled to something. He blames us. He blames the police. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. It might be harsh but the truth is harsh. Some people aren’t worth saving. I’m not saying get rid of them but we don’t have to save them. It’s not a popular notion but yes I value some people over others. The person whose trying to actually work to better themselves rather than the moocher.

522,1.0,"We had a black kittykat, Kuroneko, who had the same trouble. He would occasionally pee outside the box and he got to be really grumpy. We chalked it up to stress or behavioral issues for a while, until I noticed one day that he was seriously struggling when he was attempting to go outside the box.

We got him cleared out a couple of times over the subsequent months, but we knew it would keep happening, and he was in so much pain every time. It was the hardest decision we had to make, but there was no decision *to* make, and we lost him at age five.

I know it’s a little hokey and I don’t normally believe in anything supernatural whatsoever but I like to think Neko came back as our daughter because she had some of his mannerisms as a toddler. I still miss him.

After she told me she was moving out, I immediately broke down and admitted my problems and issues and stopped drinking and really started working on myself, or so I thought.

Then when I actually had to move from our old house to a new one (still within eyesight of the old house of course) I just snapped.  Started drinking again, she recognized that pretty quickly, I admitted that I had been about 2.5 weeks after I started, but then found out through an errant text she had taken up with an old flame that lives 4 states away.  

17 days ago we spoke after she broke no contact, I stayed over at her place and had a couple tearful meetings the next day where she told me she loves him and would marry him ""in a second"" if he asks her.

I'm not too familiar with OTC drugs or anything but I could do some research and maybe find some possible options for you.

I'm in a difficult situation right now, I got booted out of the air force for a knee injury and I'm trying to get back in. I need a waiver for every medical problem I've had, and a lot of mental health problems are permanently disqualifying. It's a long process. Any over the counter medication might work though! I'm open to suggestions. Zzzquil and melatonin doesn't help me, I used those when I was working overnights and it did nothing. </speaker> <listener> My heart goes out to you -- this is really tough and I admire your attitude about it because it doesn't seem as if you're letting the difficulty deter you from trying. I'm not too familiar with OTC drugs or anything but I could do some research and maybe find some possible options for you.

","Wow.  I'm really truly sorry to hear about your friends.  I agree that everybody deserves love and affection.  Our society is really good at producing material abundance, but unfortunately is terrible at creating social bonds between people.

I think the causes of the increasing suicide rate in the US are complex, and I respectfully disagree that there's a female monopoly on power in relationships.  The competition I referred to wasn't in regards to any balance of power between men and women, it was between men *for* women.

Although it may have seemed like your friends were normal, they were clearly incredibly depressed if they ended up committing suicide.  Depression takes many different forms and sometimes it can be difficult or impossible to see it until it's too late.  I think our society is particularly bad at spotting symptoms of depression in men, because men tend to manifest depression in different ways than women (where women tend to show traditionally understood signs of depression such as sadness, men will probably show irritability or anger, or engage in risky behaviors, or engage in escapist behaviors, abuse alcohol, and so on).

Our society also doesn't validate men's emotions (other than anger) and a lot of men grow up not even being able to recognize their own emotions.  I know this from personal experience.

We had to have traps out at my job for a rat that started living in our back room which is also the employee break room.

I call pest control and they suggested putting sticky traps on it and then tossing him in a trash bag.... how terrible?!

805,2.0,"Thank you for being open to trying to help and I suppose yeah my partners suicide has made me want to help anybody that I can, I know I'm not a superwoman, you and I can only do so much. I'm trying to make something positive out of what's happened abd I've went full circle from loving a depressed man to losing him to suicide and being suicidal myself, I do understand the pain that brought me there and I'd like to stop anybody the same way I was stopped, I dunno I feel like I can relate because some worry about how their partners feel about their mental health, well I can relate and say how I felt about his, some worry about what's left behind well as he's left I can relate to the pain felt by family and friends but I've also been suicidal myself and I can relate in that aspect to.

I try to read through the suicide watch as much as I can to try and I dunno, I suppose give a bit of support to those people on the edge reaching out? That's the first issue I've come across is that not everyone reaches out and not everyone admits when they are struggling so I'm trying to let anyone I come across know that it is ok to need help, I actually think it takes strength to admit that you can't cope and I admire those that do reach out.

 I suppose there's only so many people I can comment under and I know that some are going to slip through the net, I'm not unrealistic and idealistic enough to expect myself to be a champion that can comment under everything and sometimes all it takes is one comment to help somebody, could be delaying the inevitable but I want to at least try.

Another issue that I've come across is that there are trolls and it takes one troll to tip somebody over the edge, I'm not really into social media and I don't understand how anybody can troll a suicidal person knowing how delicate their frame of mind is. I have absolutely no control over that so I'm at a loss as to how to remedy that aspect.

I suppose if I could id like to get a few groups in different time zones and countries so that it's not all one person or a few people but that actually we as an online community can band together to make some real change and I think this forum is a great place to start because of the anonymity, nobody knows anybody's religion, ethnicity, age or history so it means people can open up with no judgement. Share the load I guess?

I like your idea about creating subs, I'm new to reddit and I have no idea how it works, this is sort of why it needs to be more than one person because it'll take different skills and different opinions, a lot of trial and error along with constant change to adapt and figure out what's needed. 

I do agree with you about the lack of real life connection but my way of looking at it is an internet connection is better than nothing at all? And I think that we could serve as I dunno practicing social conversation skills on here that can be transferred and applied to real life? I was speaking to a user the other day who thought he'd never have a conversation with anyone again, we messaged for hours about minor things like movies and stuff but at the end I said to him that he's accomplished a massive step, he's held a conversation with somebody and honestly I really think that this is why a lot of people are in pain, they lack the social skills to make real connections so if they want to practice talking with me then I will more than happily oblige, I think that this kind of 'workshop' (sorry I have no idea what to call it) would need to be separate from the suicide watch though, that would be to help before things get out of control.

I do agree with you though that those on suicide watch need urgent medical attention, I'm not gonna pretend to be God and I have no training in counselling, I suppose my main ambition( if you can call it that?) It would be to have a safety net for those one the absolute edge of life who need talked down from it, sort of urgent support to calm them while they are in that moment and to encourage them to seek long term medical help.

I understand that this is why lifeline etc fits but what I've found is that it's difficult to verbally say what's on your mind but it's so easy to write it down. I suppose I want to help those that are too afraid to speak about their pain and would rather type it.

I'm sorry if this seems like a massive ramble and if none of it makes sense, I'm still trying to figure it out but I can't do it on my own and I need other people to bring in ideas and suggestions, honestly I would like to get those who are on the edge to give me an idea of what has or hasn't helped them, I know everyone is different and all situations are different but I'd still like to find out what some of the main points are.

Is there anybody else that we could get in on this? Is it worth asking the mods for advice? How do I even do that? It's gonna be a long work in progress and I don't know how it's gonna turn out but I mean it takes one spark to make a flame right? I hashed out my ideas and I've sort of brought you onto this crazy train!","I think it's really beautiful that you would do this to honor your partner's life, and, even though you couldn't stop him, maybe helping someone else in a similar place can be a redemptive thing for you, to make some sort of thing of worth and value out of an enormously painful, senseless thing in your life. I think doing what you're doing is meaningful. 


As far as your questions at the end, I don't know about anyone else to get in on this, there might be other people on various subs, who would be open to some idea like this. I don't know how you ask mods for advice, lol, I'm equally clueless about those kinds of things. I'm not even sure how helpful they would be, but it wouldn't hurt to try.

I like your idea about creating subs, I'm new to reddit and I have no idea how it works, this is sort of why it needs to be more than one person because it'll take different skills and different opinions, a lot of trial and error along with constant change to adapt and figure out what's needed. 

I do agree with you about the lack of real life connection but my way of looking at it is an internet connection is better than nothing at all? And I think that we could serve as I dunno practicing social conversation skills on here that can be transferred and applied to real life? I was speaking to a user the other day who thought he'd never have a conversation with anyone again, we messaged for hours about minor things like movies and stuff but at the end I said to him that he's accomplished a massive step, he's held a conversation with somebody and honestly I really think that this is why a lot of people are in pain, they lack the social skills to make real connections so if they want to practice talking with me then I will more than happily oblige, I think that this kind of 'workshop' (sorry I have no idea what to call it) would need to be separate from the suicide watch though, that would be to help before things get out of control.

I do agree with you though that those on suicide watch need urgent medical attention, I'm not gonna pretend to be God and I have no training in counselling, I suppose my main ambition( if you can call it that?) It would be to have a safety net for those one the absolute edge of life who need talked down from it, sort of urgent support to calm them while they are in that moment and to encourage them to seek long term medical help.

I understand that this is why lifeline etc fits but what I've found is that it's difficult to verbally say what's on your mind but it's so easy to write it down. I suppose I want to help those that are too afraid to speak about their pain and would rather type it.

I'm sorry if this seems like a massive ramble and if none of it makes sense, I'm still trying to figure it out but I can't do it on my own and I need other people to bring in ideas and suggestions, honestly I would like to get those who are on the edge to give me an idea of what has or hasn't helped them, I know everyone is different and all situations are different but I'd still like to find out what some of the main points are.

Is there anybody else that we could get in on this? Is it worth asking the mods for advice? How do I even do that? It's gonna be a long work in progress and I don't know how it's gonna turn out but I mean it takes one spark to make a flame right? I hashed out my ideas and I've sort of brought you onto this crazy train! </speaker> <listener> I think it's really beautiful that you would do this to honor your partner's life, and, even though you couldn't stop him, maybe helping someone else in a similar place can be a redemptive thing for you, to make some sort of thing of worth and value out of an enormously painful, senseless thing in your life. I think doing what you're doing is meaningful. 


As far as your questions at the end, I don't know about anyone else to get in on this, there might be other people on various subs, who would be open to some idea like this. I don't know how you ask mods for advice, lol, I'm equally clueless about those kinds of things. I'm not even sure how helpful they would be, but it wouldn't hurt to try. 


I don't mind being brought onto your crazy train, lol :) I care about this issue too. </listener>"

So she gave me cat lax to try to help the hairball and medicine to make her chill out for her next appt which was supposed to be today. 
I ended up taking her last night because she hasn’t eaten barely anything since Monday and she was having a hard time breathing. This time the vet could look at her because she was so worn out. But after X-rays and exam, they can’t find anything. So I’m at an internal medicine specialist right now for her to get bloodwork and an ultrasound. They took her back and put her on oxygen and probably sedated her so they can actually handle her. Hopefully they can fix my baby. 

As for verapamil, I’m a pharmacy tech and 1 of the brand names for verapamil is a sight misspelling of my real first name. So to pharmacy people it’s hilarious.

255,1.0,"I feel this so hard, my makeup buying went out of control after my dad died rather unexpectedly as well. (He died less than a week after a cancer diagnosis.) I was so miserable and it felt like I would never experience happiness again and when I felt a moment of joy after buying those sparkly powders, you'd better believe I chased that.

If coping with stress at your job is hurting you mentally and physically, then finding ways to destress that actually work and aren't just coping mechanisms/escapism might be beneficial. Take care of yur body (go to the gym), take care of your mind (do shit that's mentally and emotionally stimulating, go into nature, hug some kittens).

It doesn't sound practical to leave your job right now given that you have debt to pay off, and chances are once your girlfriend finishes her degree, you'll be moving anyway.

Take this time to work on the things you'd be interested in doing. You have two years of nice financial cushion to figure what that actually is.

You can start an online business reselling almost anything through ebay and amazon, legit almost anything. I saw some people selling hot sauce packets on ebay yesterday... hot sauce packets... What the fuck is going on?!?!

You feel stuck, but you aren't. Focus on taking care of yourself so you don't burn out. Seek therapy.

This is just temporary bullshit you have to deal with, and believe me at 90k a year, you're blessed. This is your one year work anniversary, it's normal. People get tired of their jobs after 3 months, congrats you made it to a year!

so basically: 1) take care of yourself physically and emotionally 2) start working on things you enjoy in your spare time 3) pay off your debt 4) by the time your girlfriend is done you'll be debt free and have a better sense of what you might like to do, and may actually be able to do them.

125,2.0,"Thanks, anxiety is such a bitch. Life in general has been a bitch lately lol.  My FH is supportive, he's worried about them having hurt feelings and feeling like I don't want to be around them.  He and I have talked out a lot of these things and he understands, it's just that lately (last time we had the skids) I went to my parents for the weekend, and have been more frequent with not being around them.  Truthfully and I have told him this recently, I DON't want to be around them 90% of the time (I &amp; my therapist believe it's because they really have been triggers for me), I definitely feel guilty about those feelings since I know they are just kids, but it's the truth.  Some super serious shit went down recently with his oldest FSD14 pulling some manipulation stunts, and they are both very spoiled and entitled children.  The most recent stunt was outrageously expensive, extremely emotional, and triggered a lot of past trauma for me.  He's more concerned about how they feel when I'm not around, I am concerned about my emotional well being.  At this point I don't know when I will want to be around them, so this could be the standard for the next few months or even year.  I have used the excuse of not feeling well, or already having plans way too much, and FH is sick of coming up with excuses of why I'm not there so I am just going to tell them the truth - that I am going through a great amount of pain currently and trying to work on myself, which means I will be spending more time alone and not at home, and that it isn't their fault or their dads, but that I need to address some painful things that have recently come up.  I will tell them, (because in my heart I do feel this way) that I hope I can fully heal so that I can be a healthier and happier person for all of us.  This will take some time I think, so I don't want them thinking this is a one time weekend thing... this is going to be the new status quo for the upcoming months.. I have to separate myself from them and all the drama crap at this point because it's negatively affecting my health.  FH knows this is going to be the new norm, so he feels more comfortable with me just telling them, instead of lying or making up excuses as to why I'm not there.  Neither one of us wants them to feel like anything is their fault so we want to have a kid friendly open dialogue about stuff tonight.  I am stressed about it, but I think it's necessary.  As far as I'm concerned they won't get any other details other than for me it's a personal thing... I think the tension is also coming from a place where this is uncharted waters... I know he is happy I am seeking some healing and he understands, we both are just a little scared about where this all will leave us in the end...  Things have been really hard lately and not seeming to get better...I feel trapped, and like my life revolves around them/ I don't really get a choice in anything and just have to deal with all the shit.  I don't even know if I want to marry him anymore because of everything relating to BM, skids, the finance stuff, emotional stuff... just all of it really flooded over recently.. I need a real break and I'm sure that makes me sound selfish but I don't care anymore.  He can put his kids first like I would expect him to but I need to put myself first for a change.  When it comes to me or the kids I choose me.  This has been a hard realization. EDIT:  I know he wants me to want to put his kids first, and I won't right now because that would mean ignoring my health.  That has caused tension.","I wish he'd be more accepting of the fact that you are perfectly allowed to put yourself first and stop guilting you for it with his sads about your role and involvement not measuring up to some fantasy level standard. This pisses me off. 




When it comes to *his* kids he needs to put them first because he's their parent. He loves them like no one else every will. He's responsible for them like no on else. How can he expect you to put everything about yourself aside to serve someone else's kids? You're your own person with your own life, work, friends, family and mental health that needs to be tended. 




This life is hard and full of booby tarps! It's an emotional rollercoaster. You can't expect another person to sacrifice themselves at the alter of your children. You can't force someone to love a kid the same way you do, it just does not work that way. Children and draining even when they are yours, even when they are overall good kids, when you don't have financial, or BM drama.




My last big anxiety meltdown has been about feeling like I have nothing of my own, it's DHs kid and DHs family (because the kid is bonded with them) and me doing all the bending to fit everyone else's schedule. Sometimes I feel like a spectator in someone else's family. We're not having kids so I will never get to have that bond but I get to live through it all.



I refuse to put myself last, it's not healthy and it makes me feel like a husk of a human being. You can't except someone to sacrifice everything for a child where they literally have no control over the final say like a parent would. If I was SSs parent I would just do things because I believe it's the right thing to do and not worry about being veto, or stepping over boundaries, or losing this person I grew close to forever should my partner and I go separate ways. I will put as much in as I have to give. I will do extra and share my emotional energy when my cup is so full it's overflowing.Working like a horse, not take care of my needs and putting myself last is not the way I will ever live again.



I've been so freaking frank with DH about my feeling deep down and he's been frank with me about his. He actually did a ton of research (reddit haha!) about being with a person who deal with anxiety.

90,3.0,"Old poster, new account.

It's been one of those fortnights where everything happens at once. I lost both my baby and my uncle. My mom is slowly dying and has been especially bad health-wise because of the shock. Somehow I'm holding it all together. I don't know how and it worries me. I don't understand how I am this calm. I am on antidepressants which makes me wonder if they're interfering. I'm also unwell at the moment. But how can you go from jagged raw on the floor grief for two days to just being normal but not completely there?

I don't feel like I've lost them. When I close my eyes he's sleeping peacefully. When I walk around the house it's just like his grandparents have taken him for the afternoon. I don't feel like he's actually gone. Same deal with my uncle.

Is this within the range of normal response or am I psychopathic? I don't understand how I can love so fiercely and yet after the initial part I'm able to keep on going? I just don't feel anything at all now.

Odd question to ask but I feel that most posters here have a fair bit of life experience and wisdom to share so it seems worthwhile asking.","I am so sorry for your losses!

The antidepressants may be interfering with your emotions right now, for sure. But it's also completely normal to react the way you are reacting.  It could be because you need to function right now and can't afford to fall to pieces (arrange funerals and all of that).  It could be that your mind knows you can't deal with it all just yet and so it will dole out the grief in pieces over the next year - or in one big hit later on when you can deal with it more easily.  It may be shock, that even though you know what has happened and is happening, at the same time you haven't truly accepted it all so there is nothing to grieve yet. Could be another reason entirely.

We all deal with these things differently, we have different ways of reacting.  For myself, I had to be strong when my father died the other year, so I could help my mother function in arranging what had to be arranged.  I didn't have the time or luxury to grieve properly.  Every now and then though I would feel something building inside of me, and I knew it was because I actually needed to and wanted to break down and fall to pieces.  So each night what I would do is go for a hot shower and just sit in there under the water.  Sometimes I would cry and let my tears mingle with the water, sometimes I would just sit and not think or feel, just stare at the wall and the water.

792,3.0,"Last week, my girlfriend left me and also revealed that she has been lying to me in a really serious way since we started our relationship over a year ago. She told me that she has another boyfriend, who she had been seeing for three years when she met me. They are engaged to be married, but he gave her an ultimatum to tell me about him (he has known about me for some time apparently) and finish things.

I'm surprisingly calm, considering the circumstances. I have had a few emotional moments, but nothing I think was inappropriate.

* Should I try to contact her fiancé to check that the information she has been giving me is consistent with what she has been telling him? On one hand, I may have an ethical obligation to make sure he isn't being screwed over (but considering he is a stranger, maybe I don't) and I'm curious about how much of her story is true.

801,1.0,"Tbh i feel like it’s ruined my life. 
I had sinus infections a lot as a kid, probably had more antibiotics than the average kid, but the infections were always controlled with antibiotics. 
I got this infection in 2014 when I was living in London. I’m from Australia where the air’s pretty clean. The pollution and smog in London definitely made my sinuses worse and the nature of the public health system in London wasn’t ideal for me because each time I went back to the dr I’d end up seeing a diff practitioner and after 9 months of living there, i’d been on over 10 diff types of antibiotics. I think this definitely contributed to the infection now being antibiotic resistant.
I came home and had various surgeries which didn’t help. Went on diff medical trials which unfortunately weren’t effective for me. 
I feel like it’s ruined my life because I’m studying post grad opera. I managed to study for a year in 2015, but my voice was very husky and on and off and I haven’t been able to sing in the 3 years since. The chronic infection leaves me with a constant post nasal drip which irritates my lungs, that makes me cough pretty much constantly and all the coughing has damaged my vocal folds. For a few years I had polyps on my vocal folds. They’ve healed now, but I can’t stop coughing still which means my vocal folds are constantly swollen and I can’t sing. I’ve now moved across the country to this great performing arts school and haven’t been able to sing once or participate in any of the singing classes or operas in the last 3 years which has been a living hell. Soooo yeah. I’m now so out of shape vocally and multiple teachers have told me I can’t pursue a career in music with such unreliable health and that now I’m getting too old esp having not sung for years. Pursuing another career isnt really an option because it’s the only thing that I’m super passionate about so I’m just kind of living in limbo til my sinus health improves. 
Least my snot’s impressive amirite.","Oh man. I am so truly sorry. I really hope they find *something* that can help you get your life back to how it was... That just breaks my heart. I figured maybe it's just a nuisance but you're right, that's totally screwing your life up!

It really sucks how we treat antibiotics. Soon your story is not going to be all that unheard of. That's why I was so curious how it affected your life. I get on everyone to make sure they finish their antibiotics and try to tell people how scary a world with antibiotic resistance is.

I had sinus infections a lot as a kid, probably had more antibiotics than the average kid, but the infections were always controlled with antibiotics. 
I got this infection in 2014 when I was living in London. I’m from Australia where the air’s pretty clean. The pollution and smog in London definitely made my sinuses worse and the nature of the public health system in London wasn’t ideal for me because each time I went back to the dr I’d end up seeing a diff practitioner and after 9 months of living there, i’d been on over 10 diff types of antibiotics. I think this definitely contributed to the infection now being antibiotic resistant.
I came home and had various surgeries which didn’t help. Went on diff medical trials which unfortunately weren’t effective for me. 
I feel like it’s ruined my life because I’m studying post grad opera. I managed to study for a year in 2015, but my voice was very husky and on and off and I haven’t been able to sing in the 3 years since. The chronic infection leaves me with a constant post nasal drip which irritates my lungs, that makes me cough pretty much constantly and all the coughing has damaged my vocal folds. For a few years I had polyps on my vocal folds. They’ve healed now, but I can’t stop coughing still which means my vocal folds are constantly swollen and I can’t sing. I’ve now moved across the country to this great performing arts school and haven’t been able to sing once or participate in any of the singing classes or operas in the last 3 years which has been a living hell.

A few years ago I dated an amazing nurse in Vandy's Neuro ICU, who then broke up with me out of the blue.  I loved her and was having a really hard time of it, so my brother started running with me just to hang out with me and get me out of the funk.   It worked.

710,2.5,"Thank you. I believe a pain management doctor who saw me in the hospital years and years ago at the height of my diagnosis put some kind of flag in my file. He was an awful person and an awful doctor. He didn't even know me and would come into my hospital room, offer absolutely NO assistance and just take me off any kind of pain meds. My mom was almost always with me because I was still only around 20-21 at the time and I'd never even been to an ER before my Crohn's let alone one hospital admittance after another. So this house pain doctor walks into my room and basically says too bad, nothing he can do and I started crying. My mom was there, she was in tears. I was devastated as it is. My life was ripped out from under me (I missed my college graduation during my first hospital stay). I was scared. I was in pain. I couldn't get any help. Doctors didn't seem to have any clue what was going on with me because I also had a horrible case of c-diff at that time, but didn't know it because the doctors were too incompetent to even test me for it. So yeah of course I fucking cried. I was crying for a lot of reasons. But these people weren't helping me with ANYTHING. The very least I was getting was a little help with pain and then he walks in and says I can't even have that. I cried every time I was in the hospital in front of many doctors because those were hands down, the worst years of my life. Now here I am 10 years later and I'm not in pain to the point of hospitalization all the time like I was before, but I still have very real health problems that cause chronic pain. I can't even get a doctor to listen and I think that's the hardest part. I feel like I get written off before I even walk in the door.

I wanted to be successful and I have pushed myself through every devastating road block that's been put in front of me. I once went to a pain management doctor and the office was filled with addicts. Like it was blatantly and sadly obvious. The doctor barely even spoke to me and wouldn't help me at all. I just wanted to scream at him because he's obviously supporting the drug habits of so many people yet he won't even give me a second glance for real problems.

Finding dates isn't the issue, finding someone worth YOUR time and effort is the struggle. You got this though, I did and I was definitely where you are. It sucks, but plaster on a smile and push through. You have to love yourself too. Don't just keep looking for someone to give your love to. I'm rooting for you dude! You got this!

210,2.5,"I think I struggle most with the fact he was dying slowly with heart failure and two years ago he started fainting and I thought he was doomed. But once he was diagnosed and on medication he went back to his old self! It was a miracle. And every six months or so something would happen and we’d have to adjust his meds and then he’d be fine! So I’d been doing heaps of reading on heart failure and I had been trying to plan and prepare for a “good death” and I’d always paid dog sitters when I was away to be with him and I’d sourced his meds cheaper and his whole illness management took quite a toll. I was constantly making sure his quality of life was still okay. 

So when another dog attacked him and I couldn’t stop it I just kept screaming “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” cause this was not the end I wanted for him. He was in shock and we both were covered in his blood but at first the vet was hopeful! I couldn’t believe it. He jugular was exposed and trachea torn but he was still fighting to live! Even with his dodgy heart meaning too risky for a general he was stapled back together and came home briefly. But I knew something was wrong and he couldn’t walk properly or eat and he never again wagged his tail or barked and he was like a zombie dog with his whole “Butchness” gone. He did still try and be close to me even in that terrible daze of the day after the attack. 

Vet said it was maybe medication so lowered the dose but he went into a long seizure snoozing next to me and if I’d had a gun I would have shot him right there cause I finally understood what a loss of quality of life looked like. I think he was brain damaged and was never going to recover. He started leaking brain fluid and I raced him to the vet and asked for him to be put down straight away to stop even one second more of him having to fight. So I got to hold him and be with him as he passed and I’m grateful for that last bit of time at home we had. That little dog had been around longer than any partner in my life, longer than my kid, longer than any house I’d lived in and he was just so,so loyal to me right to the end. 

I feel like people are rushing me to get over it asking about getting another dog or trying to distract me and no one knows how to comfort me. Like there were no flowers and cards and funerals etc. No one rings to check if you need a casserole dropped off. I did get him cremated and his ashes are back home. I ended up at the doctor a mess with flashbacks from the attack and nightmares and doc gave me placebo level of Valium and told me to try CBT online. Ugh. I saw him put diagnosis “grief” in his drop down box but it’s strange how society doesn’t actually make space for the grief of losing a pet. I still had to work, parent, pay bills and cook and I don’t think that helped my mental state. Its been a few days since any flashbacks now and I am sleeping again but now I’m just a bit angry at everyone who assumes I’m over the trauma of the last two weeks.  I still miss Butch every day.","That was a traumatic and horrifying experience for you and a terrible end for Butch. I’m glad you got to hold him as he passed, but I have to say it sounds like the vet should’ve helped him pass directly after the attack instead of patching him up and sending him home.

My dad was not an emotional man. He never said he missed me, maybe dropped an 'I love you' every other year. We didn't hug, or joke around all that much. I always perceived him as a decent Dad but very distant. If people asked me if my dad was missing me while I was away studying, I'd shrug and say probably not.

He passed away last year, and it was only after he died that I learned how much I meant to him. He kept everything. He had my first drawings, every awful piece of art or writing, cards and letters he'd written me that he'd been so shy he couldn't send. Everyone who spoke about him mentioned how proud he was of me, how he didn't shut up about me. His wife (my step-mum) told me that he cried on the regular, and stressed himself out about texting me just to check on me or talk because he was worried he would annoy me and be an 'overbearing' father. He used to collect things to send me in care packages, worry that I wouldn't like them, and then give up. When he did get a text from me, he'd spent 10 minutes laughing at whatever I said and trying to figure out what to say to make me laugh back. Again, I thought the time between messages was disinterest. I was so wrong. He was just socially anxious with his own daughter.

I never knew, and because I never knew I never understood fully what I meant to him and I was deprived of the chance to show him how grateful I am for that. We both thought we would annoy the other one if we called or texted, even though we both wanted to talk. We wasted so much time!

So please tell him, talk to him as much as you want/need too. I'm sure people here have similar stories to mine. I promise you, I would so much rather have rolled my eyes at my dad calling me for the third time in a week than found out he cared when it was too late.

*Edit* - to the people gilding me and sharing their stories, thank you *so* much. I had no idea when I wrote this it would resound with people so much, I'm truly touched.

I love my Dad, it's always felt like him and I against the world. He pseudo adopted me when he met my mother who has Bipolar disorder along with some heavy narcissism. They broke up around age three, she has been an off and on again mother. My Dad continued to man up and be my father. I remember when we shared a bunk bed at my grandparents house. I found out a 18 over Facebook from my genetic father's girlfriend. It was hard but brought my Dad and I closer, I left for the Navy not too long after. When I was gone I kept pretty close with him. He's continued to be my rock after I got back as I currently live at home with him. I've continually heard how he talks about me when I'm not around and hearing how proud he is. My Dad is a pipe fitter by trade a man's man in a lot of ways. He's never been great at conveying emotion to me, and I can't say I've been great either. Is it weird to say I miss when he used to sing me to sleep? He's always wanted me to live my own life and not to influence it, but sometimes I just wish I could hear from him that I'm doing the right thing. I know when I left and came back I changed a lot, dealing with new anxieties and struggles. Maybe I'm just imagining things, but he was my best friend.

The Rainbow Bridge Poem;

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.

There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.

All the animals who had been ill and old, are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt, or maimed are made whole and strong again. Just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.

The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing. They each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.

They all run and play together...but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers.

Suddenly...he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster, and faster.

You have been spotted.

When you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face. Your hands again caress the beloved head. You look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.

Then... you cross the Rainbow Bridge together.

345,1.5,"Thank you so much. 

I don't have a support system. More and more lately, I'm realizing I've only had that very, very briefly a rare few times in my life.

In the last few years, I've been allowing myself to feel pride in being where I am. I used to feel never good enough because I wasn't middle class, didn't have much, etc. Now I realize that I've done so much alone and I've come so far from where *I* started.... That I've outdistanced all those people I thought of as better than me, going by distance.

If life were a car race from California to Florida, I started in Alaska with no shoes, no money, and no map. I've finally made it to the starting line and people think I'm crazy for celebrating.","Making it to the starting line is sometimes harder than the actual race, isn't it?  I'm proud of you.  

You pulled yourself out of that hole all by yourself, where so many others could not.  You pulled yourself up and made it from Alaska to California, something most couldn't do even *with* shoes and a map.  

You are a freaking rock star.  

Now that you made it to the starting line, I expect you to absolutely crush this race of life.  Go do something amazing.  Do something that the haters, with their cushy little childhoods, could never do.  Put your awful past to use making you into a force for good.

Last night at work, one of my employees, a 64 year old man, came to me around 8:00 pm looking like complete shit. He said his chest hurt, his heart was racing, and he was having trouble breathing. I immediately dropped everything and drove him to the emergency room. He lives about an hour away from work, so I called his wife, informed her of the situation, and told her I’d stay with him until she could get there. She told me she couldn’t drive, and would have to get her daughter to come over and drive her in. No problem, I said, take your time. So I checked him in, and stayed with him while they ran tests. I got a few calls from his wife, apologizing that she couldn’t get a hold of her daughter, and would be longer than anticipated. Again, no problem, take your time.

Cut to almost 1:00am. He’s still there, in serious pain, having spent the last four plus hours being poked, prodded, and XRayed. His wife and daughter finally arrive, and I pull his wife aside to tell her what’s happened, and what we do and don’t know. She’s sweet, and grateful, and obviously a bit scared. The daughter, on the other hand, spends twenty minutes complaining about what a huge inconvenience this is, never once asking how her father is, and even goes so far as to ask why I didn’t drive the hour or so to a hospital closer to her house.

I didn’t do what I did for praise, or thanks. I did it because one of my employees is sick, and it was the right thing to do. I did it because if my dad got sick at work, I hope to god someone would do the same. But for fucks sake, I just spent four hours in The ER with your dad, I think a little fucking gratitude is in order.

I said my goodbyes, promised to check in on him, and went home, but it has been bugging me. A simple thank you would have sufficed.

96,1.0,I'd pick the last time I got to see my mom smile and laugh. It's been so long since she's been gone I don't even remember what that looked like...,"A tip to remember stuff like that is to think on a memory you shared with them. Don't try to remember the person alone you never will, your brain doesn't associate memories that way. To really relive a moment in your life first pick a memory allow yourself to pulled back and relax; think of the smells, the taste, the texture of something in that memory it tends to be the easiest thing to remember. Next move your focus to the surrounding area, the things around you, the people pressing around you, the furniture, the stuff in the background. Next remember how you felt, was there anticipation, joy, anxiousness, anger, fear?  Find it and hold onto it. When you have all of that then replay the memory, what went on, what happened, go over ever exact detail that you did that you can remember. At some point you will hear/see them in it and then you will remember in exact vivid detail and it will feel like it was back then and finally the pain will hit you again.

It's been so long since she's been gone I don't even remember what that looked like... </speaker> <listener> A tip to remember stuff like that is to think on a memory you shared with them. Don't try to remember the person alone you never will, your brain doesn't associate memories that way. To really relive a moment in your life first pick a memory allow yourself to pulled back and relax; think of the smells, the taste, the texture of something in that memory it tends to be the easiest thing to remember. Next move your focus to the surrounding area, the things around you, the people pressing around you, the furniture, the stuff in the background. Next remember how you felt, was there anticipation, joy, anxiousness, anger, fear?  Find it and hold onto it. When you have all of that then replay the memory, what went on, what happened, go over ever exact detail that you did that you can remember. At some point you will hear/see them in it and then you will remember in exact vivid detail and it will feel like it was back then and finally the pain will hit you again. Its going to hurt and pull up some ugly painful emotions, but it's the best way to remember and as long as you have those memories they will always be there and bring you comfort. Just remember if she was a good mom that she loved you and you meant more to her than life itself. </listener>"

- Your coach and teammates might think they're respecting your injury and giving you space. If you want to be involved, tell them! Show up to practice and do your PT exercises on the sidelines. Ask if the coach needs an assistant.

I felt horrible and guilty during the whole thing but today I’ve managed to cut myself some slack and realise that I could’ve frozen but instead I managed to do something, even if it was just a bit. 

I was thinking about it today and I don’t know *what possessed me* to see what was happening and instantly run to the door, considering that I didn’t know if the person had a knife or was crazy enough to keep stabbing people. I just didn’t think. But I also didn’t put myself in danger, so I luckily still had common sense. I’d like to think that if I ever see myself in a similar situation I’d do the same. 

I was somehow not *too* panicky, it’s crazy what adrenaline does to you. After the adrenaline wore off I was just really spaced out and emotional. This experience has really made me want to do proper first aid training so if something happens again I feel a bit more in control and can help more. We were lucky that our chef is trained and that she was super calm and collected but next time she might not be there. I spoke to her today and she also had a rough night after she got home, but she’s ok. She has spoken to the guy today and he is ok and recovering from surgery (they had to reattach a chunk of ear and suture the gash on his head).

Not in any kind of self harm or suicidal way, just a general sense of unease about how I deal with things. Yesterday, I was very distraught about the break up, I cried on and off and worried about it all day. I went to bed, woke up, and it was gone, like turning off a light switch.

I don't know if it's gone, or just blocked off, and that worries me, that there's this hidden pit of emotions in my psyche that I could someday trip and fall into.","Hey dude, I'm by no means a psychologist or anything, but that sounds like a relatively normal grieving response to me: you started processing it, and it hurt so your brain found a way to bury it by shutting off all the feelings - good or bad - about it.

They shouldn't be taken as ultimate truth, but you might have heard about the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. They can apply to all kinds of loss, not just death, and everyone experiences them differently, in different combinations and orders and often people only experience some of them.

As I said, they're not ultimate truth, and they're not hard rules, but they are often a useful way of understanding how we respond to loss. It sounds to me like you got the depression first, then moved on to denial, but rather than denying the events have happened you're subconsciously denying that you ever cared, denying that it matters to you.

It actually sounds very similar to how my brain's dealt with important personal relationships ending in the past. It hurt at first, then for a long time I snapped into a state where all the feelings were just 'gone' like you say, it was like I'd never cared about the person at all, but I knew I had. It was just my brain protecting itself until there was enough distance from the events for it to start safely processing shit about it again.

It is good to not bury these things, but sometimes burying them for a time is a perfectly normal part of the process. The fact that you did have a really emotional response in the first place means you didn't just totally bury it in the pit of emotions, and you'll probably start to process it again soon, when distance makes it easier to deal with.

Again though, not a psychologist/counselor or anything similar, just my 2c as a human.

I've been depressed for like the past 4 years and its been a fuckin struggle, especially this past year.

Again, this past year has been really shit, kind of culminating with shit going on with this girl I love but it's weird. I have felt broken and lost and I honestly I don't really have a lot of reasons to be alive right now.

But devils hockey has been a nice little break from the emptiness. Despite having absolutely no personal connection to the state of New Jersey, it's always been fun to be a Devils fans even through the ups and downs. Ever since 2012 it's been a wild ride and I'm glad to have experienced it, makes these victories and future successes to come taste that much sweeter. I don't really like talking about my personal shit cause it doesn't feel like anyone really cares but I'm thankful for this subreddit and the shitposting in the game threads and everyone in it you know. I don't really have a lot to live for, but that won't keep me from getting hype for getting rid of 5 long years of frustration

Let's get a fucking win tonight

#FUCK THE RANGERS","FUCK THE RANGERS, FUCK THEIR FUCKING FANS, FUCK THEIR FUCKING SHIT HOLE. FUCK THEM ALL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.

Sports is a great thing. It picks you up and gives you something to hope for. When your team is winning you feel like your winning. No matter what its a great feeling when the team wins. Often when the Devils or the Steelers are winning I feel like anything is possible. 

Its only one step on your journey though. If your feeling the way you and aren’t getting help from a therapist you should. You sound young, let me tell you from an older guy: get on top of this shit now. The bravest and strongest thing you can do is admit you need help understanding your psyche. I didn’t. WhenI I had a complete collapse in my forties I almost lost everything that meant anything and everything i gad worked my whole life for.

Its not going to get better until you treat it for what it is: a chronic disease.

Hopefully you’re already doing it and Im just being a douche telling you the obvious.

It seemed fine when I checked on it an hour ago but I wasn’t paying much attention to it as I was concerned with feeding mama hamster and installing a new water bottle into the cage. When I looked around the cage I saw the baby hamster lying flat on its back, limp. Took it out of the cage and basically threw it away (no backyard to bury it) but the whole thing was so sad. 

I’m thinking of giving my other hamsters away. I’ve been going back and forth on this decision since the babies were born as I didn’t know mama hamster was pregnant, so was totally unexpected. Thought I could do it and everything was going to be fine, but I don’t think I’m ready for the responsibility and I think others would be a much better owner. Do you have space in your life for a hamster or know a loving capable person who wants a hamster/hamsters? 
","It’s so sad when runts pass. My last surprise litter had 2 and one passed as well. I wish I could help you out. I run a home-based hamster rescue but I’m rehoming 20 currently, already past my maximum. 

For the moment, they are too young to go anywhere. Please don’t be too hard on yourself, these things happen. Focus on feeding your little guys healthy nutritious food for now.

&gt; You're hardly a drain on the economy, either

I've been going to therapy for 19 years and I don't feel like i've made any progress. The government pays for my therapy sessions, medicine and transport. So I am a drain on the economy.

&gt; Honestly, I'm having a fun time talking to you, and listening to your perspective. That has value to me.

And when you get bored there's no more value. Like I said, you normies just treat us like a zoo to have your fun and then you leave.

No, that's not true. They didn't choose to never invite me because I like chilling on my own. They didn't invite me because I am ugly af.

That said, you work. It sounds like you work hard. And not everyone has to go to college-- not going to college doesn't make someone a loser, either.

And I gotcha with the therapy. I've had years of it myself, and I've found that some therapists work better than others-- but that is just my experience. And you taking care of yourself isn't a drain on the economy, but an investment in yourself. And that's important, and good.

i’m at an imaging center rn &amp; while i was doing my mri, i asked the nurse/tech to stop b/c i was getting extremely anxious (i have generalized anxiety disorder &amp; i’ve been stressed out this entire week). he suggested to give me valium to calm me down before i do the mri, but i didn’t know how my dad would feel about that ‘cause i don’t want him or my mom to think i’m a weak-ass bitch or that i’m overreacting when i’m not. i tried to tough it out as much as i could before i told the nurse/tech to stop. now i’m waiting for my dad but he’s taking so long to get here (i need someone with me if i’m taking the valium). </speaker> <listener> My current job is different but for years I worked in an imaging department and MRI was a regular part of my work. So I speak from experience when I say : there is NOTHING weak about needing an anxiolytic medication for an MRI. It is loud. It is confined. The person's medical illness can add discomfort or anxiety. All these things add up and it is not at all uncommon for people to need some medication. Do not beat yourself up or put yourself down for needing medication to get through the MRI. In fact if you need another MRI, please talk to your doctor and your parents ahead of time so that you can decide about medication ahead of time. </listener>"
882,2.0,"Lost my baby in November. I was required to get the vaccine for work, so even though I was skeptical, I still got the flu vaccine. I wish I could have stopped myself from getting it.

i think it’s interesting that you mentioned that you lost someone at a very young age and that is the reason you have it — i lost both my mom and dad suddenly to heart attacks. i am going to read the book you recommended.

one question i have for you is — i have been trying to exercise but my HA starts flaring up if i am sore or when i am doing cardio... i feel like something is wrong and immediately start to have a panic attack(i am able to stop them, but i am working very hard to *prevent* them from happening)

overall again — thank you so much for this post.. it gives me hope. ❤️","Sorry for your loss. That must be very hard. 

I know what you mean about exercise and soreness. My abdomen has been sore in the same spot for a few months now. I've had tests and scans but you know how it is...they could have missed something. Both a paranoid thought and unfortunately could be true too.

I tried exercising the other day and made my abdomen worse it seems. Maybe that means it's just a muscle strain!

Anyways I really feel like HA at it's root, for me, is about accepting. Accepting suffering. Accepting death. Worrying can't prevent either. You can't escape it. But do you really want to spend your time worrying? No matter how much time we have or what suffering is ahead, why not enjoy the moments we can enjoy. The moments without pain. The moments we are relatively healthy. Soak them up. Live them. Don't waste them worrying *before* the actual worrying is granted. 

Hope you can find some peace.

My wife is part of the recurrent miscarriage clinic and had been taking low doses of prednisolone (and other tablets/vitamins) but obviously didn't help this time. 

I read on another thread that the fetal tissue can be tested, is this something we can request?

Ask your doctor/insurance about [Anora testing](https://www.natera.com/anora-miscarriage-test). Some insurance will cover it after 3 mcs (and if they don't, I think it's maybe a couple hundred bucks to pay out of pocket). I believe all it can really tell you is whether there was a genetic abnormality that contributed to that particular loss; it can't tell you anything about prior losses. But it may provide some information at least. Also, just some unsolicited advice: if you do decide to pursue the fetal tissue testing, it may be best to choose the D&amp;C so that the doctor can collect enough/the ""right"" tissue. I was given a collection kit to take home during my second miscarriage (which started very suddenly), but the tissue I sent in turned out to be all maternal tissue rather than fetal tissue. Collecting it myself was a very unpleasant experience, and we didn't get any information that time.

It is much more important to focus on things other than women that make you happy and give you a sense of self. It's easy to say be confident but very few explain how to get there. Basically it's about shifting ones focus onto yourself and finding out who you are. If you find something you don't like you work on it and eventually come to like the person you are. It's hard tho </listener>"

538,1.0,I just learned a valuable lesson in this. I went to a startup recently. Been working a lot (100+ every week including weekends) and have been really stressed out trying to get funding. I put my personal life on autopilot for months. I just snapped out a couple days ago. I know I didn't but it feels like I lost everything in my personal life. Now I’m incredibly depressed. I know I’ll get over it and everything will become normal. All I can say working all those hours wasn’t worth it.,"I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope a few months from now you'll be in a better place. Best of luck to you.

&lt;rant&gt;
I'm 30 now. I've been a member of one union or another since I was 16 and only left the last one a year ago (I loved that union but they're unfortunately not related to my current field and the one that IS related is a shit show)

So, as somewhat of an old union hand: Your worker's rights and worker's benefits are something you should hold in the highest regard. Fight for it. If not for yourself then for your brothers and sisters. Do NOT let your employer take you for a ride. Ever.

Did that sound like some kind of communist to you? If you're not a millionaire at least you've been had by propaganda. Look into unionizing and look into workers' solidarity. Now more than ever.
&lt;/rant&gt;

Sorry about that but sometimes it's necessary to remind ourselves that people literally died so we'd have an 8-hour-workday. A 40-hour-workweek. Don't throw that away just because you like your job.

685,1.5,"Well, I missed last week. Things have not been great in 0rganic Land. My grandmother passed away last Sunday. She had been sick for a while, the dementia had kicked in around 2009 and had been getting steadily worse since. We had caretakers with her for the last six-seven years because she needed someone with her 24 hours and unfortunately she had been become very mean and aggressive in the last two or three years, and it drudged up some personal stuff for mom and she couldn't handle it sometimes, so she couldn't live with us. So we went down there Sunday and got her out of the house. My mom drove down first and I followed her down after an hour or two, and she was just in no state to drive back home, so by the time we even got home it was midnight but neither of us could sleep. I watched Spirited Away and cried like an asshole when the train left the bath house and during the visit to Zenibaba's house. I did all the driving for my mom the next day, who was a wreck because she had a migraine on top of four hours of sleep, and we had to meet my scumbag uncle at the funeral home to discuss all the stuff you discuss when a person dies. I basically plied my mom with soup and tea for most of the night until she finally fell asleep, and she was better the next day. Thankfully I have some of the greatest friends on the fucking planet, and one of them drove me down to my grandmother's house the next day so I could get my car (left if there when I picked up my mom) even though it's an hour away. 

My sister flew in and I picked her up from the airport, and then we got slammed with a northeaster, so we couldn't have the funeral until Friday (which the church almost fucked up by scheduling the wrong date). My two uncles and their annoying kids who never visited my grandmother (their mother) more than once a year if that and who never helped my mom with anything, money, moving stuff, finding care for my grandmother, never even called her to see how she was doing, nothing, all showed up, and I just wanted to tell them to go away. They didn't give a shit about her while she was alive. Some family friends of mine and my mom's showed up, though, even my best friend's parents (he's moved away) to the funeral and our neighbors, and they made the whole thing bearable. My mom was a goddamn mess again, just crying through the burial. It was awful, honestly, there's no beating around the bush. She spent the last nine years taking care of her mother knowing it was going to end like this. She even got sick at the luncheon afterwards, during which we surrounded ourselves with our family friends and kept the family at the other side of the table. One of my uncles barely talked to me or my sister the entire day, and when he tried to walk out without saying bye I purposely grabbed him and said bye just to fuck with him. None of them thanked my mom for handling the arrangments, or for paying for the funeral, or for paying for the luncheon, and they fucking stiffed us for their drink bill at the end. They're assholes one and all and I'm glad I don't have to see them again. 

I got my mom home and she was sick as hell again, not eating, so I cooked shitty soup for her and made sure she ate until she fell asleep. Thankfully she was feeling better by the next morning. Drove my sister back to the airport Sunday, and we started the slow process of cleaning my grandmother's house out. I'm still exhausted, honestly. By Sunday I felt like someone had kicked the shit out of me between the lack of sleep and emotional fatigue. My mother and grandmother basically raised me when I was younger, and even though she was so out of by the end it still sucks that she's gone. The caretakers said she was calling for me, my sister and mother at night during the last week, but not in a sad way, it was like we were little kids again, telling us to get ready to go to the park or the pool. I feel like hell, but I'm happy she's not suffering and angry anymore, even if she's dead. I just want it to be Thursday so I can go to happy hour with my friends, have a couple beers and sort of get back to normal. I've got a lot of thinking to do about my own problems, which this death has cast into stark relief. I've just playing games in my spare time, it's the only thing I can seem to focus on right now, so if you've made it this far and have any cool recommendations throw them my way. Peace out.","Losing a loved one is always tough. I imagine it's even harder when they're as close as your grandmother seemed to be. It's good that you're managing to stay strong though. I imagine your mother will thank you for it, especially considering how shitty the rest of your family was acting.

449,1.0,"I appreciate the effort, though that's really not a feasible approach. This is something I've struggled with for years, and honestly it just comes down to having to stop playing the game.

I don't know why it is, but for some reason, I feel like Nintendo has been increasingly bad about this sort of thing in recent years. There was an issues in Yoshi's Woolly World where amiibo Yoshi's would be ""out of order"", and it's something that just makes it impossible for me to enjoy.

It's dumb, because I firmly believe that Mario Odyssey may actually be the best game in the franchise, but this one thing has completely killed my capacity to play. And what makes it so bad, it that I WANT to keep playing, but... well, it's difficult to describe OCD to people, other than ""it's like having this nagging feeling that you're supposed to be doing something"", this intense anxiety, and it just doesn't go away.","While I completely understand the hardships that disorders come with, being a future psychologist, it's not up to Nintendo to cater to persons with anxiety disorders. Like, at all. I hope you're getting help for your OCD, because I know it isn't easy. But not every company will cater to all the possible customers they may have.

This is something I've struggled with for years, and honestly it just comes down to having to stop playing the game.

I don't know why it is, but for some reason, I feel like Nintendo has been increasingly bad about this sort of thing in recent years. There was an issues in Yoshi's Woolly World where amiibo Yoshi's would be ""out of order"", and it's something that just makes it impossible for me to enjoy.

It's dumb, because I firmly believe that Mario Odyssey may actually be the best game in the franchise, but this one thing has completely killed my capacity to play. And what makes it so bad, it that I WANT to keep playing, but... well, it's difficult to describe OCD to people, other than ""it's like having this nagging feeling that you're supposed to be doing something"", this intense anxiety, and it just doesn't go away. </speaker> <listener> While I completely understand the hardships that disorders come with, being a future psychologist, it's not up to Nintendo to cater to persons with anxiety disorders. Like, at all. I hope you're getting help for your OCD, because I know it isn't easy. But not every company will cater to all the possible customers they may have. Its like asking Niantic to only put Pokéstops in wheelchair accessible places, and blaming them when they don't.

93,1.0,"Woke up feeling great, stomach feeling much better, started announcing some old stuff to sell and collect some money to help with the rent of the new place. Then my ex-wife calls me screaming, telling me I have to call our daughter's orthopaedic surgeon because his office called to give a budget quote for her surgery. Okay.

*My daughter had surgery when she was 3yo to correct a birth defect on her hips. It's a rare condition, just a few doctors in the country do this surgery. Now one of her legs is a couple of inches smaller and has a couple more issues. The surgery wasn't covered by the health insurance and was expensive AF. She now needs to level both legs and correct another deformity she has developed on her hips*

So, I called the doctor, he explained the surgery to me for the Nth time (it'd be in a month or so) and I KNEW it would be REALLY expensive because he wasn't getting to the point quickly. And then he threw the bomb: the cost is equivalent to 24 times the minimum wage. Not even our car is valued at that. 

My mood had already took a hit when I messaged my ex-wife to tell her because I know how desperate she gets, so I knew what to expect as I reaction.  I explained the surgeries and after telling her how much it costs, I was drowned with a flood of insults, how much worthless I am, how much I am not worth anything..you get the idea. 

I mean, I am unemployed surviving on random freelance jobs, so she isn't totally wrong I could be helping more. But it's so dumb to think I'm don't care and I'm being lazy just because it was EASY for her. She left college already employed and now she's jumping from job to better-job and now works on the best private school in city, earning a VERY good salary. It ain't that easy for everybody, she's blessed to be in a situation like that but thinks fucking everybody should be. She's never had to keep sending resumes or asking around for jobs. She doesn't know that. She does't know what struggling is. Her family has properties around the city, so if there's any issue, they have Backup plans A, B and C. Not me, I am basically fucked if it gets any worse. She can't fucking understand that. 

I am still processing it all. My mood has taken quite a big hit with this situation. Very tough shit to handle. 
","My man. That shit is rough. I recently went through something similar. My ex flew in from vacation with the kids. Didnt remember to book a ride from the airport with car seats. 


I was at the movies, phone off. She called once, then apparently thought her whole family should call me. I walked out of the movie to 20 different text messages and voicemails from her parents, sisters, etc. All about how I am so selfish and worthless that I wouldn't pick them up at the airport. #1, my phone was off. #2 we are 99% no contact due to shit like this. The last time I told her I wouldn't agree to a severe change in our schedule, when threatened to file a restraining order because it would ""just be easier to get what I want"". Which is also why I will now only exchange the kids with her at a police station.

But still... that shit gets in your head. You start to think ""am i worthless? Am i selfish?"". The answer is no. But it takes a lot of self-care to come around to that. It gets easier though. Just remember that you cannot out-argue or out-logic crazy, and trying to do so will only make you look crazier. 

I am sorry to hear about your daughter, but it sounds like you love her very much... in doing that and being there for her as a dad, that is the best job you can do. 

Also... one day I am going to croak, probably before my ex. So I keep a journal for a lot of different reasons. First because i hope that one day my kids can know me as a person, not just dad. But a secret hope is that all the crazy shit the ex says will be seen. 

I had a similar experience with my parents, mom saying a bunch of things that just weren't true. But who was I to NOT believe her. My dad had already passed. Then I found his journals in an old box a few years later.  Let's just say it was quite enlightening and cleared up a lot of confusion I had about my parents relationship. 

If you chose to do something similar, just dont turn it into a bitch fest focused on trying to prove yourself right/worthy/better than. Just describe how you feel similar to what you have now. What are your fears if the surgery doesnt happen? How will it effect your daughters quality of life? Just ask and write from a place of love.

If you've got time to Reddit, then you've got time to sleep. Trust me, Electrical Engineer here, worked construction as an electrician while going to University. Your days are hard, very much, but they'll pay off soon. The best ""mind hack"" I ever did was to continually convince myself that it WASN'T hard and stop complaining to myself (you do need to vent to people sometimes but cut it way down). The workload can be depressing but you can do it. You can succeed. You will be successful. Don't let yourself give up. </listener>"

452,1.5,"Good evening Ari. If you could give me your advice I would really appreciate it, the matter means a lot to me. I was married to a Jewish girl who divorced me and married a Hasidic Jew. Worst part is that my daughter lives with them and my ex is raising her in a strict tradition - the costumes, kosher only food, Jewish kindergarten, changed her name and now she wants her to go to a Jewish school where teachers only speak Hebrew and when I approached the school they plain and simple refused to answer my questions. She is six now and I've seen her doing things that just break my heart. She would tell me that I'm not her family since I'm not Jewish, she had hysterical breakdown when I took her for a drive on Saturday, she would barely want to talk to me, she tells me nonsense about Greeks being mages back in the day etc... It's pretty hard to look at. I can't take any legal action since she lives in a different country and the only recourse I have is that I can talk to her. 
What would you think, what kind of questions would make her realize what a sect that really is? To make her see not only positives but also limitations put on her? I still hope I will be able to bring her to US and send her to college, I have some leverage with my ex... But my little girl must want that too instead of just marrying a Hasidic Jew, putting on a wig and spend her time looking after children...","I'm so sorry this happened to you and your daughter. It's sad, but not necessarily the end of it. Quite often, the kids in situations like this end up realizing what was done to their parents and start questioning things.

Now, if you want specific advice on how to handle it, I may not be the right person for it as I was never in your shoes. But, I can tell you that Hasidic folks don't change because of outside pressure. I suggest you ask questions with her, get her to be the one asking questions from you. Hasidic Judaism isn't really good at answering questions, fill that gap, make sure she knows that you'd answer them.

739,1.5,"My Dad passed away on April 11 unexpectedly, and it's been pretty horrible.  It really has changed the whole experience for me, and I'm struggling.

In the end, I am pushing forward with things as planned.  But I can't lie and say I haven't had some really terrible moments.  Taking my Dad's name off of the guest list, the rehearsal dinner, having his name on the invites that were ordered well in advance assuming he would be here...it's been crushing.

Aside from losing my Dad, my Mom won't be able to afford to live on her own and I'm the only one here with her.  I take care of her the most, and she'll likely be moving into a house with us once we can look for one after the wedding.  My brother and his gf also got into a car accident on the way home from my bridal shower, our rehearsal dinner had to be cancelled because our officiant suddenly can't make it...there have been so many other things!  So there's grief and financial stress, the stress of the wedding itself - and the impact of being newlyweds taking in my mother.

I go to therapy and I talk there a lot.  My fiancé is my sounding board, as are a couple of friends.  It is not easy - and you just need to listen to your gut and do what feels right.  I admit I've felt not just sad - but angry, resentful, and jealous of the many people I know who had the wedding and wedding related events they wanted, with everyone they know and love present.  I'm fairly angry at the world right now.

I'm very sorry that you're enduring this though.  I already hadn't been enjoying wedding planning, and this all made it much harder.  At the end of the day, I would have done all of this A LOT differently!  But i couldn't have known all of that up front.

Lots of people talk about cancelling, but it wasn't a real possibility for us.  We'd lose money on all of the deposits (we're paying ourselves), and we are already financially stretched thin as it is. I'm sure people will have suggested that to you.  If it's something you can or want to consider - do!  But it just wasn't real option for us, and not one I wanted to even consider.  And there's a Six Feet Under episode where a character loses her pregnancy the day before the wedding and was a wreck, but she felt that the only thing worse than going through it would be to have to go through cancelling everything.  And that's how I've felt.

What I'm trying to do is focus on the fact that I'm marrying someone I love.  I am lucky for that.  I'm also happy to know that my Dad knew and approved of my fiancé.  

I've just felt timing wasn't on my side this year - at all.  I feel you!  If you want to message me, please do.  I'm happy to talk or just listen.  You need to be able to vent and feel supported.

I hope that therapy and love carry you through and you have a beautiful-if-bittersweet day that honors your love for your partner, your dad, and everyone else you hold dear. 

We don't have to decide whether to cancel because we haven't really even started. All we have is a rough guest list, rough total budget number, and a very early search of venues.

Today, I woke up to him constantly shaking and losing his balance. He wouldn’t eat any of his favorite treats, and I decided to let him go. The vet said she could try to hospitalize him, but she didn’t expect him to recover since his body temperature was 10 degrees lower than what was normal. 

I miss him terribly, but I’m glad that he is no longer in pain. And even though he could barely walk this morning, he still mustered enough energy to curl up next to me while I got ready. He used to sleep right next to my pillow, and my bed feels a lot emptier without him.

One day, I woke up to him crying downstairs. He couldn’t move his back legs. I rushed him to the vet. He had a blood clot called a saddle thrombosis and only 50% of cats ever recover movement.

Mine was a single mother and thank god I spent a lot of time with my grandparents or I would never have survived childhood. I'm 35 now and I've given up a lot of my life to take care of her, finally getting up the courage to stand up for myself and tell her to deal with it herself or die has been amazing, not having the constant stress feels incredible. You'll get there, it sucks but you have to put yourself first instead of them and there are support networks for people like us that want to help instead of reddit dickbags that don't understand what it's like.

249,1.0,"I became single about 18 months ago after a failed 9 year relationship. 

I got into another relationship within a month (not a great idea). He was a psychiatric nurse and unemployed at the time, so I think I became his pet project. It took him 6 months to convince me to finally go on meds and thank god he did, he was also with me for my diagnosis. He taught me boundaries and social skills and I owe him so much. However, he's also stopped talking to me for months because I've had episodes, and it hurts like hell. He's not in love with me and we've never been exclusive. So I'm trying to move on. 

I feel like I may finally be healthy enough to date at this point, but I'm not where I want to be. I'm starting grad school and a job by the summer and I think ill be a very different person then.

I've decided at this point not to aim toward relationship goals.

I wish you all the best of luck in your romantic journey, don't date just anybody and don't settle, you are worthy of all the love and there will be someone compatible with you!","I wish you all the strength to move on.

Being lied to, repeatedly, is infuriating... even more so when it's being done by one's SO.

&amp;#x200B;

It might be worth a try to steer the convo away from things like telling him he needs to stop lying/making promises and instead ask him about why he's lying to you rather than simply telling you the truth.

Peel back the layers of the onion.  Yes, him making and breaking promises to you is terrible and I get you wanting him to stop doing that to you.

WHY is he doing that though?  That's what you should ask him.  I mean, his actions are saying loud and clear that he doesn't want to have sex even though he's saying let's do it tomorrow morning, then he puts it off to later that afternoon, then to the next day etc.

His words ring hollow as you know all too well.

Tell him that his actions do not line up with his words and that you want actions and that you no longer want him to lie to you.

Tell him that if he doesn't want to have sex to say that.  Instead, he's trying to pacify you by saying ""sure honey, we'll have sex tomorrow"".  He knows he won't have sex with you tomorrow but he's trying to make you feel better right then by telling you that and he's putting off dealing with it then.  Then when tomorrow comes, he puts it off yet again.

Why does he keep doing this?  Because it's working for him.  He isn't having sex by doing this, saying these things.  

&amp;#x200B;

That's a cycle I'd have to break.  I'd be like ""honey, don't tell me we'll have sex in the a.m. and then when the a.m. comes you tell me to wait until the afternoon and then when the afternoon comes you tell me to wait until tomorrow and then tomorrow comes and you don't and you tell me we have to take a rain check.""

1) *{long distance internet hug at your comfort level}* Tears are a healthy, cleansing part of life. It's ok to be scared and teary. Don't let it push you into a panic right now, but don't squash your feelings either. 

2) Love doesn't solve all problems. It makes you more motivated to find solutions, but it's not a solution in and of itself. He's got to get a new outlook that isn't ""oh look, a miraculous solution to our significant problems fell from the sky and landed in my lap!"" He can certainly steer his ship in a better direction if he wants to, but he needs to start wanting to. In no way do your feelings and fears right now mean the relationship *has* to end. Scrub that out of your head, because I sincerely doubt you're at the point of no return right this second. 

3) I think you should consider some couples counseling, or if that's not in the budget then committing to working through some of the couple's relationship-building books and worksheets that are free on the internet or cheap at the bookstore. It seems like the two of you love each other dearly and have a plan for the future, but that plan needs some more details for you to feel secure in it. For financial stuff I like Gail Vaz-Oxlade (I may have misspelled that, Amazon knows who I mean), and I'm sure some other Redditors will have suggestions for communication stuff. Make a date to sit down and talk about stuff as a team, and talk about what you're afraid of. 

Story time: I'm not a kid person, but my fiancé is. He wants to have a child someday, and the thought of that scares the pants off me. I'm afraid of what will happen to the body I work hard on, whether he'll be attracted to me after. I'm scared of losing my identity as a person and just becoming Offspring's Mom and not the scientist/runner/scuba diver/hockey fan I am. I'm scared I'll be left all the responsibility of a kid and he'll be a traditional ""parachute dad"". So we talked about it. Over and over and over. He said he expects to be an equal dad, and he shows that now by being an equal member of the household with chores and bills and the emotional labour. He said he loves me not just for my body but for the dedication I put in, and he shows that by asking about my new lifting records and making a silly sign when I run a race. What it boils down to is he pairs words with actions. And that's why I've come around to raising a child with this man. 

You've said that you're afraid your fiancé doesn't have the motivation. That's fair, he might or he might not right now.

What it boils down to is he pairs words with actions. And that's why I've come around to raising a child with this man. 

You've said that you're afraid your fiancé doesn't have the motivation. That's fair, he might or he might not right now. But after you talk and you agree about what to do, watch to see if he pairs action with words. That's the sign of someone who is committed to your team. </listener>"

* Lay off the pot. Might or might not have anything to do with it, but better be on the safe side and try out how it is without.

Instead try to do general healthy stuff for you and your brain, e.g. healthy food, exercising, regular sleeping schedule, enough hours etc. Maybe find out if you have any deficiencies (e.g. magnesium). This can do wonders for both anxiety and depression.

* Get out more and take a sketchbook with you. Getting out not only helps with the first point, imho it's very important for inspiration. And sketching as a habit helps to really see and engage with what you see on a creative level. It's like starting to write and letting a story come to you - start to draw and let ideas for art come to you. You also expand your visual library and skills that way.

Save your money and leave when you can.",3,4.0,2.0,"<speaker> I use to have a psychiatrist but for the last year it's been just my general physician. Where we live now is in a city about 70 miles from the rest of our family, where we are both from. We moved in with in laws because of job opportunities in the city and public transportation. We desperately want to move back it has turned into a shit show but husband's mom is very unstable and unpredictable. She takes advantage of us living there and lives vicariously through us. She'll lay in bed for days at a time. Legitimately may get up to pee once in a 24 hour period. Her other son has cerebral palsy/low functioning autism and is 12, not in school so during the day we care for him too. There's a lot of red tape trying to move back home. 

And thank you for your input, I don't have the money for co-pays and I'd have to travel far to be seen...none of which is impossible just makes it harder to get the mental help I need.

 I wasn't looking for a diagnosis as much as having a better idea of what's going on or if there were any dead ringers, but you're absolutely right that I need to be seen and I appreciate it. </speaker> <listener> I would like to interject here that your in-laws somehow survived without you and your husband before you moved in.

499,1.5,"Hey, sorry to bug you on a hockey sub but yesterday my mom was officially diagnosed with Breast Cancer and I'm obviously a little freaked out. 

The good news is that because she's really cautious about it she found it really early. She went to all of her mammograms and checked herself often too. That being said she is a diabetic  and is in her mid 50s. They're going to remove it surgically and possibly go into a bit of chemo. 

Should I be really worried? I know in Canada the 5 year survival rate across Female Breast cancer patients from 2006-2008 was like 83 percent or something, and they found it early but..

My sister is on her third hamster. It's never easy when they pass. They're just as easy to love as a cat or dog but they have such short lives :(

The first two girls lived more 2 and a half years each. It is unfortunate that they age so quickly but they lived happy, comfortable lives with plenty of cuddles, excersise and human food (but only stuff that is fine for their health).

I like that even small animals like hamsters display such different, unique personalities.

Atop of that I'm thinking of dropping out of college, it's gonna start in a month but I've hated every minute of me being there the past year. I haven't really talked to anyone outside of class for the whole year and just feel so alien.

I don't know what to do however, I have to have a job or be in education to be able to live where I do or else I'll get kicked out and I'm running out of time.

&gt;I haven't really talked to anyone outside of class for the whole year and just feel so alien.

Hey, at least you made it further than me, I dropped out after half a year, also because I just couldn't handle the social... situation, or environment or whatever you would call it. Alien... is a good word to describe how I felt

&gt;Why can't I just be social or something?

I don't know your history, but I'm pretty convinced these things are very often the cause of ... whatever happened in your past.

To me, that shows it's partially how I was born, you, I, we're all just the product of the chemicals in our brains, unless you believe in a soul, that's all there's to it... And as such, there's a million and one ways in which we differ, and a million and one ways where imbalances can fuck shit up.

Regardless, bullying for that length of time, will leave it's marks. I too hated life, more than anything, without exaggeration there were years where I would not go a week, without laying in bed, crying to myself unable to think of anything else but how ... peaceful it would be to die, how it'd make all the pain and anguish go away.

After I quit school... things got better, and so... Please, PLEASE, do not give up all hope, the switch from school to work is huge, bigger than high school to uni... It's no heaven, there's all kinds of new shit to deal with, but in regards to humans... it gets better I think. I could never have imagined how different life would become, and change is slow... but, before you know it... you might look around you and think ""huh... I guess life's not the worst"".

I can't give answers to your other questions, hell, I clearly haven't figured half the shit out myself... but don't kid yourself into thinking the other people you see are normal... If I've learned something the last few years, it's that you have NO IDEA how many of the people you think are ""normal"" are dealing with sooo much things...

I too hated life, more than anything, without exaggeration there were years where I would not go a week, without laying in bed, crying to myself unable to think of anything else but how ... peaceful it would be to die, how it'd make all the pain and anguish go away.

After I quit school... things got better, and so... Please, PLEASE, do not give up all hope, the switch from school to work is huge, bigger than high school to uni... It's no heaven, there's all kinds of new shit to deal with, but in regards to humans... it gets better I think. I could never have imagined how different life would become, and change is slow... but, before you know it... you might look around you and think ""huh... I guess life's not the worst"".

I can't give answers to your other questions, hell, I clearly haven't figured half the shit out myself... but don't kid yourself into thinking the other people you see are normal... If I've learned something the last few years, it's that you have NO IDEA how many of the people you think are ""normal"" are dealing with sooo much things... The same things as you, other things as you... but you are **not** alone in this.

Fuck it, I'll try and be brief: I was sexually assaulted and when I went to see a university therapist about it, she told me that it was entirely my fault because men are conditioned to think women are lying when they say no, that men lose control and it's up to women to prevent that from happening, that men are more likely to rape women they don't respect (because the guy knew I'd had casual sex before so therefore he was justified in thinking he could take it from me), and then chastised me for not practicing safe sex even though I was NOT AWAKE when he went inside of me. That's not even all of it but those are the main things that have stuck with me years later. 

When I complained to the university about it they told me it was ""a misunderstanding"" and refused to provide me with another therapist, and even the university priest I eventually sought out pointed to the therapist's seniority as if well respected people must be right in whatever they do.

I’ve never connected with anyone or any pets like that before or since </speaker> <listener> I'm so sorry for your loss. The loss of a good friend (which pets can especially be) is really tough. Have you anyone else in your life to talk to? Sometimes it helps to talk about experiences you've had. It's also a good idea to get bereavement counseling in some situations.

In my situation I'm very upset with the vet because he missed all the issues with my dog's 'good' eye. My partner was examining our dog and it could be a severe infection or a minor stroke but (on Wednesday after a five minute examination) we got sent home with eye drops and a mild antibiotic. Tonight we noticed that our dog couldn't properly close his right eye and didn't respond much when waggled our fingers close to that eye. My buddy is likely to be ok but this vet should have known to examine any dog brought to him better. </listener>"

She lost a LOT of weight in her first 5 days so ended up in hospital and we left with a feeding plan including topping each feed up with formula. She had latching issues and would fuss so much on the boob. When we were told we could stop the plan and start feeding on demand, she was never satisfied from just breast feeding so every feed was a boob battle followed by her guzzling a full feeds worth of formula.

I lost all motivation at that point. She was past the deadline of it being snipped locally and would need to get referred to a hospital further away and it just seemed too daunting and unnecessary when she is happy and healthy. The idea of continuing boob battles when I now knew that it would never improve without intervention was just stressful. So we packed it in.

I constantly feel the need to write out that full story to explain myself and it's ridiculous. But everyone always asks if I'm still breastfeeding when i get the bottle out and I can't get away from the judgement.

Everyone at work knows that I have rats and so a few of my co-workers offered to cover so I could leave early. None of my co-workers really understand why I love rats so much, but I'm glad that they could at least understand that it meant a lot to me. </speaker> <listener> Aw I’m so sorry. Dino was my first rattie as well. I had mice prior to him but rats are definitely different. That was nice of your coworkers willing to cover for you. For them to at least understand that you were upset. I had to go to the bathroom a few times a work to get myself back together today because I kept tearing up. And when I finally got home from work my other two ratties definitely were acting different. They definitely knew and were sad themselves. I have one tan rattie who is partially blind and he normally doesn’t like being pet for too long but he just sat with me and let me stroke his back for the longest time after work today and it really helped my heart feel better. The love and emotion they have is amazing. I love them so much </listener>"

153,1.0,"TW: talk of other people’s pregnancies (and a bloody long post).

So yesterday/today was/is a hard day. 

My oldest/closest school friends and I have a whatsapp group that we talk throughout the day on. 
One of my friends who started the TTC game with me who I shared the rollercoaster of emotions with, became pregnant but had been pretending to not be (refer to previous post about the associated drama/shenanigans)...and so since then our DAILY conversation has been about her pending baby. Anyway yesterday it was this lengthy talk about how she wants a specially crocheted blanket for her baby and wishes one of her friends to gift her baby with it (she knows I crochet blankets for friends babies) so it was very much *hint hint.*
Maybe it’s me, but she knows how hard TTC has been for me so far, we talked daily about our struggles and fears and I don’t understand why she isn’t being a little more sensitive. 

Then on top of that, one of the WAGs who can’t help but go on about her fertile she is and how both her daughters were born on the first sex...she has always been very forthcoming/opinionated about natural birth and breastfeeding and no screens and cloth diapers, like the list of opinions is endless. She often makes other WAG mothers feel crap, from what they’ve told me. Anyway she gave birth 4 months ago and has now become a wellness mum instagrammer and is giving out “inspiration tips” on how to be like her. 
I can’t explain why it rubbed me up the wrong way but it’s the realisation that people around me are having babies and looking/feeling great and I’m here still POAS, “left behind” struggling to get fit/healthier.
 I just wanted to be honest that my lack of confidence and progress on the baby front is making me feel bleurgh about other people’s successes. So I suppose I just want someone to tell me that I’m not the worst person in the world and that this normal, because I certainly don’t feel that way :(","Mrs Fab! How insensitive is your pregnant friend, and how annoying is your instagram friend! 

CW: loss
After my loss, I thought ""alright Marbles, let's get fit and healthy and lose some kilo's and then get back in the game."" Well, here I am 4 months later. Still the same weight as the day after my loss. It's hard to get the energy and motivation when you're not where you want to be in life, and when you're seeing other people with the things that you want in life. So you're not on your own. Be kind to yourself.

Alsooooo, I know I've had a good bitch about my SIL on this sub, but she literally lies on instagram every single day. People eat it up and assume she is this ""natural"" mum who has her kids eating organic veggies and taking her kids on great adventures. Well, she actually feeds her kids sausages (and not many veggies) and sits on the lounge watching tv, not taking the kids on adventures. And I know so many people that do this. They want you to believe their life is amazing, even if it's not. SIL was also insensitive about her pregnancy with me, so now I barely speak to her. But I feel better in my day to day life.

Do whatever you want, if you want a break from these people then go nuts. Or maybe tell them what's going on so they can be more sensitive. If they are good friends then they should understand. And you're not the worst person in the world. I've seen your posts, you're a great person. Don't ever forget it.

35,1.5,"Just got an email an hour ago from Soldier-On ( A canadian charity sort of speak for injured military members) Anyways, it was saying I was chosen to go to my cities NHL teams game in a luxury suite with 10 of my friends if I would also share my story with the crowd. 

I have already wrote back and said no thank you. I just cant come to terms with being celebrated for my service. I did a lot of things i'm not proud of. I dont have enough digits on my body to count the times I wish I would've died over there. Not only have I really struggled with PTSD for years, but also survivors guilt. Why did I make it home, but my best friend didn't. My other best friend has lost both of his legs and one arm. Here I sit with just my mind being messed up. I cant imagine what it is he has had to deal with. 

I'm not saying this for some sympathy vote. I know there's some other service men on this reddit. I'm wondering if they feel the same way as I do. I know some guys are really proud of what they did. They wear their medals on the regular. Personally, mine is gathering dust in my closet and will probably never see the light of day again. 

So now I focus all my effort on bodybuilding. Its what keeps me alive. And i mean that. Without it, I would surely be dead. 

Any other service men out there wanting to chat, hit me up. Not sure why this simple email I received is messing me up, but I guess i'll just use it as fuel in my next workout. 

 

","Just think of it this way.

You shoulder the burden so others don't have to. You take the weight for others who couldn't bear it. You went and fought and saw things and did things that are inconceivable to the average person so that average person could sleep soundly. 

Literally, you gave up your safety and the peace of mind for the rest of your life (unless you come to terms with everything) so others wouldn't have to think about it at all. 

While you might not want to share your story with a crowd (and thus not go to the game and everything), hopefully you can see what it's like to those of us who understand how awful things can be in war but are lucky to have not been in those situations themselves.  

Life's a journey. Try to be thankful for everything you go through. When you suffer, when you cry, when you're happy, when you're angry, try to relish what you feel and what you experience. With the bad things, it's sort of like giving yourself Stockholm syndrome; if you can learn to love the worst experiences just for yourself being alive and present there, you'll certainly be able to appreciate your life as a whole. Side note: when I'm doing cardio (in particular, stairclimber) or slaving away at manual labor or anything else and the sweat and pain and everything are wearing me down, I remember that whole idea. I learned to fall in love with the feeling of ounces of sweat rolling off me and the overwhelming heat and the torn calluses from shovels and everything else. Feeling stuff is pretty incredible if you really try it. It took me years and years to figure that one out.

One day, on your deathbed, you'll look back and be thankful for every second you spent on this rock, even the ones that seemed awful at the time (or for years afterwards). If you can convince yourself now that every moment and every feeling are a miracle of chance, you won't have to search for a reason to go on; living will be the reason and you'll never regret it. Good luck.

Note: the example has a level of purpose to it even though I am not advocating you tell the world you brush your teeth better, even though you should or something..

##1) Find a small thing you can do better every day and can be proud about.   
It does not matter how little or large it is - it is for you. Whether it be brushing you teeth better or picking up a piece of rubbish on the road that someone else left there - find a thing you can do. 

##2) Become an expert at it.   
Make those Chompers pearly white. This takes time. It will take several weeks for any results but you will start to notice the difference and so will others. Change doesn't happen overnight and committing to change is what will bring about those thoughts of accomplishment.

##3) Tell someone.  
Or just fucking say it... In the mirror or at the park on a bench by yourself. Vocalise your achievements no matter how small or large they are. ""I brushed my teeth better today than yesterday, and I have been doing it for a month and now my teeth are very healthy"". Ask yourself what you achieved today, say out loud you achieved it, and move on to the next thing that you need to achieve.

##4) Rinse and repeat   
Ain't nothing like practice to make things perfect. Find little things you can do something about and get better at them. Tell yourself you succeeded when you do it. Literally fucking say it. You will find in time that the bigger things are more achievable either in one step or by breaking them up into smaller steps.

158,1.5,"Thank you. I miss him so much. He comforted me in a way that only he could. It does feel like they are treating him in death the way they treated him in life. They have violated his privacy and gone against what his wishes would have been. He was distant and very private toward them and had a lot of boundaries in place with them. I feel like they took his death as an opportunity to try to see what was going on inside his mind, so they hacked everything they could. But this isn't what he would have wanted.

I feel like I can't keep going. I did contact a grief counseling agency and they told me I need to wait 3 months after he has passed because I'm in too much shock right now. It made me feel upset and frustrated. I know I will never get over this. I pray for an early death.","Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling in the sky the message He is Dead, Put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun. Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; For nothing now can ever come to any good.

W. Auden Funeral Blues

This is the poem that brought me comfort because it perfectly captured how I felt. I want you to realize that you gave him an incredible gift. No one should ever leave this life having never known love and hope, and because of **you**, he was able to know both in his final years. That is a gift that is beyond compare. You gave him real unconditional love, and hope that he was going to have a happy future. That is so important.

Also think about how he didn't want you to be hurting or suffering. He wanted you to be ok. And because of that, you will be. 

Loaing someone you love is the most intense pain there is. Right now you are being knocked down by these huge tsunami size waves of grief. As the days go on, those waves will get smaller and smaller. They will never go away. I won't lie to you. But they will be more tolerable. They will always be there, but in smaller and smaller ways until its more like standing at the edge of the beach and having waves up to your knees cascading past, instead of drowning you. One day you will come to embrace those waves because they bring with them all the good memories you shared him. So right now all you can do is keep treading water, keep yourself afloat until your feet can touch the ground again. Take it five minutes at a time. You've made it through the last five, you will make it through the next five.

His family is desperately trying to grasp for what little control they have left over him now. That is why the hacking and not considering what he would have wanted. They will remember him in their way, as messed up as it is, but you are here to remember and honor the *real him*. That is what you can do for him now. You can be the person who was most important to him, who knew him best, and who can honor him the way he would have wanted. Always remember that he finally got to experience love and hope because of you. That is, frankly, the best gift you could ever give to anyone. And you did that.",1,1.0,2.0,"<speaker> Thank you. I miss him so much. He comforted me in a way that only he could. It does feel like they are treating him in death the way they treated him in life. They have violated his privacy and gone against what his wishes would have been. He was distant and very private toward them and had a lot of boundaries in place with them. I feel like they took his death as an opportunity to try to see what was going on inside his mind, so they hacked everything they could. But this isn't what he would have wanted.

I feel like I can't keep going. I did contact a grief counseling agency and they told me I need to wait 3 months after he has passed because I'm in too much shock right now. It made me feel upset and frustrated. I know I will never get over this. I pray for an early death. </speaker> <listener> Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone. Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling in the sky the message He is Dead, Put crêpe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.

He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong.

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one, Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun. Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood; For nothing now can ever come to any good.

W. Auden Funeral Blues

This is the poem that brought me comfort because it perfectly captured how I felt. I want you to realize that you gave him an incredible gift. No one should ever leave this life having never known love and hope, and because of **you**, he was able to know both in his final years. That is a gift that is beyond compare. You gave him real unconditional love, and hope that he was going to have a happy future. That is so important.

Also think about how he didn't want you to be hurting or suffering. He wanted you to be ok. And because of that, you will be. 

Loaing someone you love is the most intense pain there is. Right now you are being knocked down by these huge tsunami size waves of grief. As the days go on, those waves will get smaller and smaller. They will never go away. I won't lie to you. But they will be more tolerable. They will always be there, but in smaller and smaller ways until its more like standing at the edge of the beach and having waves up to your knees cascading past, instead of drowning you. One day you will come to embrace those waves because they bring with them all the good memories you shared him. So right now all you can do is keep treading water, keep yourself afloat until your feet can touch the ground again. Take it five minutes at a time. You've made it through the last five, you will make it through the next five.

His family is desperately trying to grasp for what little control they have left over him now. That is why the hacking and not considering what he would have wanted. They will remember him in their way, as messed up as it is, but you are here to remember and honor the *real him*. That is what you can do for him now. You can be the person who was most important to him, who knew him best, and who can honor him the way he would have wanted. Always remember that he finally got to experience love and hope because of you. That is, frankly, the best gift you could ever give to anyone. And you did that. </listener>"

It sounds hard  as I'm sure you feel drained and low on energy. But the little things add up and really helped in the bigger picture for me. You just need to get the ball rolling. No more zero days. Everyday make a little improvement. Even if it's going for a 10 minute walk you otherwise wouldn't have. Or reading 5 pages of a book. I read a few books that helped. The Chimp Paradox and The Power of Now being a couple. It know it sounds like ""blah blah self help"" BS but it really helped me a while ago. 

Fuck the taboo/stigma behind mental illness. Just do what you need to do to get yourself better pal. If you ever need someone to talk to my PM's are open. </listener>"

I just still don't know how he died. I wish I had the vet do the autopsy, but it was gonna be really expensive and I couldn't afford it back then. 


Archie was always a healthy bunny and there were no changes indicating that something was wrong. He was behaving completely normal the night before, eating and cuddling with me in the bed before I put him in his cage for the night. The cage was in the same room as my bed, but I heard nothing. When I woke up in the morning, I found him in his cage lying on the ground unable to move his head. It looked like he did something to his spine, because his head was twisted in a really weird position and he was not able to lift it up. He had no control of his head at all. I know about head tilt, but I've seen pictures of it and it looked a bit differently. Besides, it literally happened over night and progressed so quickly. 


To this day, I still think that he probably waited on me to get up, because he died in my arms 10 minutes after I found him and started frantically calling the vet :(  I also tried to feed him with no success. There was just no chance to save him anymore and I still kind of blame myself for what happened and if I could have somehow prevented it.

I remember being devastated over it for a long time and even now I still cry when I think about it.

897,1.5,"So I'm fucked off at my father still. I'm actually contemplating borderline disowning the cunt as this stage.

A few of you know a few years back I postponed my application for Pre-Medicine to head back across the country to my home town and put my palliative nursing skills to service in looking after my last remaining grandparent, my Nana because my dad was running himself into the ground trying to be full time carer for himself and my mother who lives with a disability. And his sisters (my cunt aunts and extended family did fuck all to help)

At the time my Nana's prognosis was something like 6 months and so I thought after it had all came to pass I could go back to Melbourne as re-accept my deferred application. This also stops Nana going into hospice which was something that she and everyone else didn't want at the time. Being in a small town the home nursing services are incredibly limited and not really of help.

So I move in, 4 months in, she gets a diagnosis of spontaneously remission in her secondary cancer, (she had metastatic skin cancer, and her chemo/radiation combo gave her secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma), so her prognosis for an extended life is longer in that regard other than the increasing debilitation of her skin cancer.

So the best part of 5 years drag on, my Pre-Med Acceptance is declined. I'm a 24/7 live in nurse across all aspects of care and house keep for Nana so she doesn't have to be in a home. Little time off othe than a couple of chances to get away. No energy or time for a job as well, other than reddit, there wasn't much else to keep me sane. 

One week after the funeral the cunt aunts and my dad ask me to leave the house or start paying rent (bearing in mind i was not paid other than a small government stipened for looking after Nana for ll this time, which in hospice fees alone would have been $130k a year at least).... So they can sell the place asap and get the money. I move into a friends house, buy a car and drive across the country to move here. The house sits empty for 18 months. I get no family member saying thank you for looking after her, but her friends in the community did.

Now, Nana was cremated after the funeral service and it was her wishes to be returned to her home of The Isle of Wight in the UK and be scattered there. Her ashes have been sitting at my aunts until someone goes back to the UK or they mailed her because that's what she wanted.

I get a SKYPE message at 1.50pm my time yesterday from my cunt father that reads in part ""we are going to scatter (most) of your Nan's ashes today at 2pm in the river (of my home town) so she'll be with your Grandad. A small parcel of her ashes is on it's way to the Isle of Wight""...

I get NO prior warning so that I can be there, I get nothing. I spent the better part of 5 years looking after Nana when no one else was willing to, and informing her of her rights across her medical care and ability to make informed decisions in regards to her care instead of just making her or guilting her to  do shit like her fucking kids did... and I don't even get invited to see her final farewell.

When I asked why I or my sister wasn't told sooner, I got told that I couldn't have afforded to go over there anyway... I'm thinking in my mind: You fucking CUNT you were given over $120k in inheritance, you could have flown my sister and i over and back if you wanted us there....

I'm beyond pissed and upset. I know that if the tables were turned it would have been the worlds biggest drama.

Now she just spends my money and yells whenever the impromptu vacation house isn’t up to her standards. </speaker> <listener> That was for you. I figured you had a reason. Coming from a mom. 

My mom had a really sad childhood too (her mom died when she was three, she was passed around between family members because dad couldn’t handle her alone, then he remarried a woman with the same name and had a new family...). She came back from that and was the most amazing mom ever without anyone to model from obviously. I hope that you have that for yourself too some day. Kids deserve so much more. I hope my mom knows how much we appreciate it. She got hit by a semi four years ago. I help take care of her but she has brain damage.  Forgiveness is the only thing that heals you. Helps you move on. Doesn’t mean it’s okay, it means you choose to not live with the chains of anger and bitterness. Hard stuff. </listener>"

She has now been discharged and she agrees that she has a problem that needs her constant attention. She takes her medicines for now at least.

I now feel we should have forced her way earlier than we did. My sister was living with my family and they had no idea how to proceed. I constantly wonder if I should have stepped in a lot sooner than I did.","Don't blame yourself for not stepping in sooner. It's an extremely difficult situation, and the right thing and right time differ from person to person. What's most important is that she is being treated, and that you're next to her as she goes along the path towards healing.",2,3.0,1.0,"<speaker> My sister was too.

Ended up calling my mom and broke down sobbing but she made me feel better and I ended up finishing up and getting my degree. 4 years later and I have a great career and constantly think about that time and am proud of working through it.

I’ve done this before to keep him (an ex) happy. I was constantly compromising in his favor for years. From what you say you two are moving closer together. Maybe just being friends would be better for now. It would give you two the space to grow individually but still be in each others lives. 

I’m a huge believer in if it’s meant to be, then it’ll happen. You never know, it could bring you two closer. But don’t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. No matter how much you love them! You don’t seem very happy with this arrangement. And believe me, it’ll only get worse if you’re not getting what you clearly know you need.

I don't know how much comfort it offers, I know it didn't help me much when I was in similar situations, but time will pass and one day your family won't be the total authority and influencer on your worth.

It very much sounds like right now the rough waters you're in are spinning you through a shitton of emotions that are just hard to cope with. Nothing is wrong with you, you just have a lot on your plate right now. Definitely life is made from a series of experiences, and regardless of any ""what-ifs,"" you came out! That's always a hard thing to do and you can feel proud of yourself for getting yourself to this point. It's now a piece of your life story.

I highly recommend breathing and meditation type exercises. It doesn't have to be om-type stuff, just methods through which you can recenter yourself, take your mind out of any kind of hamster-wheel of thought it's on, and feel a little more stable again. It helps me a bit until nature can take its course and stuff relaxes again.",5,5.0,5.0,"<speaker> I’m sorry I was so overwhelmed when I posted this, I was litterally crying in a shower having a panic attack.
